"Signature-based intrusion detection systems (IDS) are security mechanisms that examine network traffic or system logs for specific patterns or signatures that match known security threats, such as viruses, worms, or other malware.  These patterns or signatures are typically derived from previous attacks and are stored in a database within the IDS.  When the IDS detects a signature match, it generates an alert or takes other predefined actions to mitigate the threat.  Signature-based IDS can be effective at detecting known attacks, but they are limited to identifying only those attacks for which signatures exist.  New or unknown attacks may not be detected by these systems.  As such, signature-based IDS are often used in conjunction with other security measures, such as behavior-based IDS and firewalls, to provide a more comprehensive defense against cyber threats.",1,148,876,6,90,0.6081081081081081,0.43243243243243246,5.0,24.666666666666668,35.17318181818183,13.818787878787877,17.89090909090909,15.903189008614273,14.490909090909089,0.38513513513513514,0.2546583850931677,0.13664596273291926,0.07453416149068323,0.024844720496894408,0.08074534161490683,0.055900621118012424,5,0.033783783783783786,8,0,0,0,0,0.05405405405405406,0,5

"A Disaster Recovery Plan (DRP) is a documented and structured approach that organizations use to prepare for, respond to, and recover from disasters or disruptions that may affect their critical business operations. A DRP typically involves a series of procedures, policies, and strategies that outline how an organization will continue its operations and recover its systems, data, and infrastructure in the event of a disaster or disruption. The goal of a DRP is to minimize the impact of a disaster or disruption on an organization's operations, reputation, and bottom line by ensuring the availability and recoverability of critical systems and data. DRP procedures may include steps for backing up and restoring data, relocating personnel, activating alternative communication methods, and restoring critical applications and systems.

"Data integrity is related to data security, since the completeness and accuracy of data that has been compromised can no longer be guaranteed.  However, data integrity also requires the development and testing of procedures for the entry and verification of data (input) as well as verifying the accuracy of reports (output).  Database administrators may do some programming, but generally work with the programming staff in maintaining data integrity.  Since most data in computers ultimately comes from human beings, the training of operators is also important. Within the database structure itself, the links between data fields must be maintained (referential integrity) and a locking system must be employed to ensure that a new update is not processed while a pending one is incomplete ,.

Peer-to-peer file transfer is often used for sharing files between individuals or for file sharing networks, such as BitTorrent. Cloud-based file transfer: In this implementation, files are transferred between a local computer and a remote cloud server, which stores and manages the files.  Cloud-based file transfer is commonly used for storing and sharing files online, such as with cloud storage services like Google Drive or Dropbox. Physical media transfer: In this implementation, files are transferred using physical media, such as USB drives or CDs/DVDs.

"Compilers are traditionally thought of as having a “front end” that analyzes the source code (high-level language statements) and a “back end” that generates the appropriate low-level code.  The front end processing begins with lexical analysis.  The compiler scans the source program looking for matches to valid tokens as defined by the language.  A token is any word or symbol that has meaning in the language, such as a keyword (reserved word) such as if or while.  Next, the tokens are parsed or grouped according to the rules of the language.  The result of parsing is a “parse tree” that resolves statements into their component parts.  For example, an assignment statement may be parsed into an identifier, an assignment operator (such as =), and a value to be assigned.

"Error handling refers to the process of detecting, reporting, and resolving errors or exceptions that occur during the execution of a computer program or system.  Errors can occur due to a variety of reasons, such as incorrect input, hardware malfunctions, or programming errors. When an error occurs, the program or system must be able to identify the error and take appropriate action to resolve it.  This may involve notifying the user of the error, logging the error for later analysis, or attempting to recover from the error by executing an alternative path or retrying the operation. There are several techniques for error handling in computing, including:Exception handling: This involves using try-catch statements or other constructs to identify and handle exceptions in a program. Error codes: This involves using predefined error codes to identify specific types of errors and taking appropriate action based on the error code. Error messages: This involves providing descriptive error messages to users to help them understand what went wrong and how to fix it. Logging: This involves recording error information in logs for later analysis and troubleshooting.",1,204,1173,8,105,0.5147058823529411,0.3627450980392157,4.857843137254902,25.5,30.562337707182337,14.617175414364642,17.005801104972374,15.414825405933506,13.910497237569057,0.35294117647058826,0.2980769230769231,0.16826923076923078,0.0673076923076923,0.0,0.09615384615384616,0.019230769230769232,1,0.004901960784313725,9,0,5,0,0,0.04411764705882353,0,2

"Supercomputers are always more expensive and somewhat less reliable than standard computers, so they are used only when necessary.  As the power of standard computers continues to grow, applications that formerly required a multimillion-dollar supercomputer can now run on a desktop workstation (a good example is the creation of detailed 3D graphics). On the other hand, there are always applications that will soak up whatever computing power can be brought to bear on them.  These include analysis of new aircraft designs, weather and climate models, the study of nuclear reactions, and the creation of models for the synthesis of proteins.

"Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) is a technology that uses radio waves to wirelessly identify and track objects or people.  RFID systems consist of three main components: a tag or transponder, a reader or interrogator, and a backend system for processing the data. The RFID tag contains a small microchip and an antenna, which can be attached to or embedded within an object.  When the tag is exposed to radio waves from a nearby reader, it powers up and sends back a signal containing its unique identifier. RFID technology has a wide range of applications, from tracking inventory and assets in supply chain management to monitoring patients in hospitals and controlling access to secure areas.  It provides a more efficient and automated way to collect data and streamline processes, compared to manual methods such as barcode scanning.",1,151,844,6,98,0.6490066225165563,0.5165562913907285,4.675496688741722,25.166666666666668,33.91215686274512,14.160294117647059,16.71372549019608,15.688483145680365,12.36323529411765,0.36423841059602646,0.2727272727272727,0.12987012987012986,0.07792207792207792,0.01948051948051948,0.09740259740259741,0.025974025974025976,6,0.039735099337748346,6,0,1,0,0,0.039735099337748346,0,2

"Biometrics identification systems are based on the recognition of unique morphological characteristics of each individual‚ so that only the physical presence of the person will allow access to the system.  Numerous biometric parameters are available such as: facial‚ iris‚ fingerprints‚ hand and finger geometry‚ signature and voice recognition.  Although iris recognition has stronger security credentials‚ fingerprints are often preferred due to the maturity of the technology ,.  As Table 4A outlines‚ Retina Scan‚ Iris Scan and Hand Geometry are most accurate and both‚ the False Rejection Rate (FRR) and the False Acceptance Rate (FAR) are quite low for these Authentication measures based on Biometrics.  In Table 4B other measures are outlined that can be used for Access Control.  Often a system may use a Magnetic Swipe Card and a Keypad Entry System to give an employee access to a restricted office area or a database.  Some of the time a system such as the ones outlined in Table 4B may also be combined with one of those described and explained in Table 4C.  Unfortunately‚ all the one’s in Table 4C do have‚ however‚ some severe weaknesses that limit their Reliability and Validity.  In particular the FRR and FAR may not be satisfactory.  For instance‚ during May 2002 a Japanese group of researchers reported that using fake fingerprints fashioned from gelatin were able to fool biometric fingerprint readers 80% of the time.  The researchers also devised a way to create fake fingerprints from fingerprints left on glass surfaces.  What is interesting is that the material needed to make this work‚ was purchased at a neighborhood store and cost less than Euro 11.  This attack is a classic replay (or forgery) attack.  Unfortunately‚ replays are not unique to fingerprints but are a fundamental Vulnerability of all Biometrics ,.  The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) published a report during May 2002 about the inaccuracy of tests using facial recognition technology at the Palm Beach (FL) International Airport.  The technology failed to correctly identify faces more than half of the time.

"File cache is a type of cache memory used by computer operating systems to improve the performance of file system access. When a file is accessed, the operating system will store a copy of the file's contents in the file cache.  If the file is accessed again, the operating system can retrieve the file from the file cache instead of reading it from the slower hard drive.  This can significantly improve the speed of file access and overall system performance. File cache works by utilizing the available memory in a computer's RAM to store frequently accessed files.  The operating system manages the file cache, determining which files should be cached based on their access patterns and available memory.  The size of the file cache is typically dynamic and can vary based on the available system memory and the demands of other processes running on the system. File cache is particularly effective for improving the performance of applications that frequently access small files, such as web browsers and document editors.  By keeping frequently accessed files in cache, these applications can retrieve them quickly and efficiently, improving overall performance and reducing wait times. However, like any cache, file cache has limitations.  If the file being accessed is larger than the available cache memory, the operating system may need to read the file from the hard drive, resulting in slower performance.  Additionally, the effectiveness of the file cache can be affected by the access patterns of other processes running on the system, which can lead to cache ""thrashing"" and reduced performance.",1,286,1610,12,109,0.3811188811188811,0.23076923076923078,4.713286713286713,23.833333333333332,44.34040697674422,12.415930232558143,16.351937984496125,14.90622815163357,12.452713178294577,0.3706293706293706,0.30716723549488056,0.12286689419795221,0.05802047781569966,0.040955631399317405,0.10238907849829351,0.06143344709897611,1,0.0034965034965034965,12,0,0,0,0,0.04195804195804196,1,0
"The Blue Screen of Death (BSOD) is an error screen displayed on a Windows computer when the operating system encounters a critical error that it cannot recover from.  The screen appears as a blue background with white text and is also known as a ""stop error"" or a ""system crash. ""The BSOD is typically caused by hardware or software issues, such as faulty drivers, system files, or memory problems.  When a critical error occurs, Windows displays the BSOD to prevent further damage to the system and to allow the user to troubleshoot the problem. The BSOD screen provides a message that includes a stop code, which can help identify the cause of the error.  The stop code is a hexadecimal code that indicates the type of error that occurred, such as a driver issue or a memory problem. When a BSOD occurs, the computer will typically restart automatically, although it may also display a memory dump or other diagnostic information.  To resolve the issue, users can try to identify the cause of the error using the stop code and other diagnostic information provided on the BSOD screen. BSODs can be frustrating and disruptive, but they are an important safety feature of the Windows operating system that helps prevent further damage to the system when critical errors occur.",1,243,1276,9,107,0.4403292181069959,0.26337448559670784,4.362139917695473,27.0,48.63964157706096,12.46494623655914,14.437071172555045,13.023866798666859,10.529032258064518,0.40329218106995884,0.24696356275303644,0.11336032388663968,0.0728744939271255,0.020242914979757085,0.06477732793522267,0.048582995951417005,8,0.03292181069958848,10,0,0,0,0,0.0411522633744856,0,5
"The preceding data types all hold single values.  However, most modern languages allow for the construction of data types that can hold more than one piece of data.  The arrayis the most basic structured data type; it represents a series of memory locations that hold data of one of the basic types.  Thus, in Pascal an array of integer holds integers, each taking up two bytes of memory. Many languages have composite data types that can hold data of several different basic types.  For example, the struct in C or the record in Pascal can hold data such as a person’s first and last name, three lines of address (all arrays of characters, or strings), an employee number (perhaps an integer or double), a Boolean field representing the presence or absence of some status, and so on.  This kind of data type is also called a user-defined data type because programmers can define and use these types in almost the same ways as they use the language’s built-in basic types. What is the difference between data types and data structures? There is no hard-and-fast distinction.  Generally, data structures such as lists, stacks, queues, and trees are more complex than simple data types, because they include data relationships and special functions (such as pushing or popping data on a stack).  However, a list is the fundamental data type in list-processing languages such as Lisp, and string operators are built into languages such as Snobol.  (See list processing, stack, queue, and tree. )Further, in many modern languages fundamental and structured data types are combined seamlessly into classes that combine data structures with the relevant operations ,",0,319,1660,13,150,0.4702194357366771,0.322884012539185,4.322884012539185,24.53846153846154,52.88703296703298,11.099633699633703,13.235164835164836,12.766815935922704,11.046886446886447,0.3605015673981191,0.28059701492537314,0.08059701492537313,0.10149253731343283,0.03880597014925373,0.10149253731343283,0.029850746268656716,8,0.025078369905956112,21,1,0,0,1,0.07210031347962383,3,2
"The compilation process is the process by which a compiler translates source code written in a programming language into machine code that can be executed by a computer.  The process typically involves several stages:Lexical Analysis: The compiler reads the source code and identifies the tokens (keywords, identifiers, operators, etc. ) in the code. Syntax Analysis: The compiler analyzes the structure of the code to ensure that it conforms to the syntax rules of the programming language.  This stage involves creating an abstract syntax tree (AST) that represents the structure of the code. Semantic Analysis: The compiler performs checks to ensure that the code is semantically correct, such as checking that variables are declared before they are used, and that functions are called with the correct number and type of arguments. Code Generation: The compiler generates machine code that can be executed by the computer.  This involves translating the AST into a lower-level representation of the code, such as assembly language or machine code. Optimization: The compiler may perform various optimizations on the generated code to improve its performance or reduce its size.  This may involve removing redundant code, reordering instructions, or replacing code with more efficient alternatives. Once the compilation process is complete, the resulting machine code can be executed by the computer's processor.  The process of compilation is typically performed by a dedicated software program called a compiler, which is specific to the programming language being used.",1,271,1575,12,117,0.4317343173431734,0.26199261992619927,4.918819188191882,22.583333333333332,33.65204113924054,13.471993670886079,17.68902953586498,15.688483145680365,14.491139240506332,0.3763837638376384,0.27697841726618705,0.12589928057553956,0.0539568345323741,0.014388489208633094,0.07913669064748201,0.06115107913669065,1,0.0036900369003690036,10,0,6,0,0,0.03690036900369004,0,0
"The primary use of text editors today is to create programs and scripts.

"A firewall is a network security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on a set of security rules.  It acts as a barrier between a private internal network and the public internet or other untrusted networks, allowing only authorized traffic to pass through while blocking unauthorized or potentially harmful traffic. Firewalls can be implemented as software or hardware devices, and they typically use one or more of the following techniques to filter traffic:Packet filtering: Examines the source and destination addresses and other packet header information to determine whether to allow or block the packet. Stateful inspection: Tracks the state of network connections and allows only legitimate traffic to pass through based on that state. Application-level gateway: Analyzes the content of application-layer protocols such as HTTP or FTP to filter traffic based on application-specific rules.

"Freeware is software that is available for free, without any cost or payment required.  Freeware first came into existence in the 1980s and 1990s, as personal computers became more popular and affordable, and software developers began to create software for these new platforms. One of the earliest examples of freeware was PC-Write, a word processing program created by Bob Wallace in 1983.  Wallace initially sold the program, but later decided to release it as freeware, allowing users to download and use it for free.  Other early examples of freeware included games, utilities, and other software programs that were distributed through bulletin board systems (BBS) and other early computer networks. The growth of the internet in the 1990s further fueled the development and distribution of freeware, as developers were able to reach a much larger audience through online distribution.  The open-source software movement also played a role in the growth of freeware, as developers began to release source code for their software under licenses that allowed others to modify and distribute the software for free. Today, freeware continues to be an important part of the software landscape, with many popular programs and tools available for free download and use.

"Eiffel refers to the Eiffel programming language, which is a high-level, object-oriented programming language designed by Bertrand Meyer in the mid-1980s.  The language is named after Gustave Eiffel, the French engineer who designed the Eiffel Tower. Eiffel is known for its focus on software engineering principles such as design-by-contract, automatic memory management, and the use of the Uniform Access Principle.  The language's syntax is designed to be simple, readable, and expressive, with features that encourage modular programming, extensibility, and maintainability. Eiffel is commonly used in developing mission-critical software systems, such as aerospace, finance, and medical applications, where reliability, safety, and security are of paramount importance.

"A binary tree is a type of tree in which each node has at most two child nodes, which are called the left child and right child.  Binary trees are widely used in computer science and data structures to represent hierarchical relationships between data elements. In a binary tree, each node contains a value or key, as well as pointers or references to its left and right child nodes.  The left child node is typically smaller than the parent node, while the right child node is typically larger than the parent node.  This ordering property of binary trees allows for efficient searching and sorting of data. In terms of memory allocation, each node in a binary tree is typically implemented as a struct or a class in programming languages such as C++ or Java.  The struct or class contains fields or members for storing the node's key value, as well as pointers or references to its left and right child nodes. Memory allocation for binary trees is typically done dynamically using heap memory.  When a new node is created, memory is allocated for the node using a memory allocation function such as malloc() in C or new() in C++.  The allocated memory is then used to store the node's key value and pointers or references to its child nodes. When a node is no longer needed, its memory is freed using a memory deallocation function such as free() in C or delete() in C++.  This helps to avoid memory leaks and ensure efficient use of memory.",1,286,1443,12,102,0.35664335664335667,0.17482517482517482,4.129370629370629,23.833333333333332,55.63791666666668,10.798750000000002,15.252083333333331,13.943154165760404,8.75390625,0.3776223776223776,0.27986348122866894,0.08532423208191127,0.09556313993174062,0.04778156996587031,0.10580204778156997,0.040955631399317405,12,0.04195804195804196,8,0,0,0,0,0.027972027972027972,0,17
"Numbers with a fractional (decimal) part are usually storedin a format called floating point.  The “floating” means thatthe location of the decimal point can be moved as necessaryto fit the number within the specified digit range.  A floatingpoint number is actually stored in four separate parts.  Firstcomes the sign, indicating whether the number is negativeor positive.  Next comes the mantissa, which contains theactual digits of the number, both before and after the decimal point.  The radix is the “base” for the number systemused.  Finally, the exponent determines where the decimalpoint will be placed. For example, the base 10 number 247. 35 could be represented as 24735 × 10-2.  The -2 moves the decimal pointat the end two places to the left.  However, floating-pointnumbers are normalized to a form in which there is just onedigit to the left of the decimal point.  Thus, 247. 35 wouldactually be written 2. 4735 × 102.  This system is also knownas scientific notation. As noted earlier, actual data storage in modern computers is always in binary, but the same principle applies. According to IEEE Standard 754, 32-bit floating-point numbers use 1 bit for the sign, 8 bits for the exponent, and 23bits for the mantissa (also called the significand, since itexpressed the digits that are significant—that is, guaranteed not to be “lost” through overflow or underflow in processing).  The double precision float, declared as a “double”in C programs, uses 1, 11, and 52 bits respectively.",0,287,1501,18,155,0.5400696864111498,0.41114982578397213,4.358885017421603,15.944444444444445,52.39569852941179,9.64654411764706,13.681092436974792,13.126405980863044,11.331932773109244,0.3205574912891986,0.19155844155844157,0.11038961038961038,0.05519480519480519,0.05194805194805195,0.07792207792207792,0.05194805194805195,19,0.06620209059233449,18,0,0,0,0,0.0627177700348432,2,8
"System programming refers to the development of software that controls and manages computer hardware and system resources, such as memory, CPU, and input/output (I/O) devices.  System programmers create software that interacts with the underlying system and hardware to perform low-level tasks, such as device drivers, operating system kernels, and system utilities.

"The transfer of data within the microprocessor and between the microprocessor and memory must be synchronized to ensure that the data needed to execute each instruction is available when the flow of execution has reached an appropriate point.  This synchronization is accomplished by moving data in intervals that correspond to the pulses of the system clock (a quartz crystal).  This is done by sending control signals that tell the components of the processor and memory when to send or wait for data.  Thus, if the microprocessor is the heart of the computer, the clock is the heart’s pacemaker.

"There are several advantages of using data abstraction in software development, including:Simplifies complexity: Data abstraction simplifies the complexity of a software system by breaking it down into smaller, more manageable components.  By abstracting away the details of how data is stored and manipulated, developers can focus on the essential properties and behaviors of the data. Enhances modularity: By encapsulating data within objects or abstract data types, data abstraction promotes modularity and information hiding.  This makes it easier to develop and maintain large software systems, as changes made to one part of the system are less likely to affect other parts of the system. Improves code reusability: Data abstraction makes it easier to reuse code in different parts of a software system, as the same data structures and functions can be used in different contexts without requiring significant modification. Enhances security: By hiding the implementation details of data, data abstraction can help to enhance security by preventing unauthorized access to sensitive data. Facilitates testing and debugging: Data abstraction can make it easier to test and debug software systems, as it provides a clear separation between the interface and implementation of data structures and functions.  This can make it easier to identify and isolate errors or bugs within the system.",1,231,1392,8,111,0.4805194805194805,0.31601731601731603,5.116883116883117,28.875,17.34596153846158,17.299038461538462,19.630769230769232,17.410965686947208,15.407692307692308,0.341991341991342,0.3162393162393162,0.14102564102564102,0.0811965811965812,0.008547008547008548,0.11538461538461539,0.03418803418803419,1,0.004329004329004329,8,0,6,0,0,0.03463203463203463,0,0
"The unusual computing term demon (sometimes spelled daemon) refers to a process (program) that runs in the background, checking for and responding to certain events.  The utility of this concept is that it allows for automation of information processing without requiring that an operator initiate or manage the process. For example, a print spooler demon looks for jobs that are queued for printing, and deals with the negotiations necessary to maintain the flow of data to that device.  Another demon (called chron in UNIX systems) reads a file describing processes that are designated to run at particular dates or times.  For example, it may launch a backup utility every morning at 1:00 a. m.  E-mail also depends on the periodic operation of “mailer demons. ”",0,141,765,6,93,0.6595744680851063,0.5177304964539007,4.5177304964539005,23.5,38.4905913978495,13.024838709677422,15.040860215053764,14.314028922438442,11.58064516129032,0.3475177304964539,0.2857142857142857,0.1360544217687075,0.047619047619047616,0.013605442176870748,0.1360544217687075,0.027210884353741496,3,0.02127659574468085,4,0,1,0,0,0.028368794326241134,0,2
"Information theory is a mathematical and computational theory that studies the quantification, storage, transmission, and processing of information.  It was developed by Claude Shannon in the 1940s and 1950s, and it has since become a fundamental tool in fields such as communication, computer science, physics, and cryptography. At its core, information theory seeks to understand the fundamental limits of communication and data processing, and to identify efficient ways of encoding, transmitting, and decoding information.  It provides mathematical tools and models for measuring the amount of information in a message or signal, and for evaluating the reliability and efficiency of different coding and compression techniques. Some key concepts in information theory include entropy, which measures the amount of uncertainty or randomness in a signal; channel capacity, which represents the maximum rate of information that can be transmitted through a communication channel; and error-correcting codes, which are techniques for detecting and correcting errors that can occur during transmission or storage of digital data.",1,183,1128,5,97,0.5300546448087432,0.3770491803278688,5.278688524590164,36.6,6.002931677018665,20.421416149068325,23.811677018633546,20.456717378047102,17.252173913043475,0.3879781420765027,0.31016042780748665,0.10695187165775401,0.058823529411764705,0.0,0.11229946524064172,0.0374331550802139,3,0.01639344262295082,15,2,0,0,0,0.09289617486338798,0,1

"One advantage of using abstract data types is that it separates a structure and functionality from its implementation.  In designing the abstract stack type, for example, one can focus on what a stack does and its essential functions.  One avoids becoming immediately bogged down with details, such as what sorts of data items can be placed on the stack, or exactly what mechanism will be used to keep track of the number of items currently stored.  This approach also avoids “featuritis,” the tendency to see how many possible functions or features one can add to the stack object.  For example, while it might be useful to give a stack the ability to print out a list of its items, it is probably better to wait until one needs such a capability than to burden the basic stack idea with extra baggage that may make it more cumbersome or less efficient.

"The quicksort improves on the basic bubble sort by first choosing a record with a key approximately midway between the lowest and highest.  This key is called the pivot.  The records are then moved to the left of the pivot if they are lower than it, and to the right if higher (that is, the records are divided into two partitions).  The process is then repeated to split the left side with a new pivot, and then the right side likewise.  This is continued until the partition size is one, and the records are now all sorted.  (Because of this repeated partitioning, quicksort is usually implemented using a procedure that calls itself repeatedly—see recursion. )Devised by C.  A.  R.  Hoare in 1962, quicksort is much faster than the bubble sort because records are moved over greater distances in a single operation rather than simply being exchanged with their neighbors.  Assuming an appropriate initial pivot value is chosen, running time is proportional to the logarithm of n rather than to the square of n. The difference becomes dramatic as the size of the database increases",0,202,1083,8,110,0.5445544554455446,0.3811881188118812,4.410891089108911,25.25,54.822043478260895,10.183826086956522,12.36,11.979248473330827,9.952173913043477,0.44554455445544555,0.18309859154929578,0.10328638497652583,0.07511737089201878,0.06572769953051644,0.11267605633802817,0.07042253521126761,4,0.019801980198019802,7,0,0,0,0,0.034653465346534656,0,1

"E-commerce has become a popular way for consumers to shop for goods and services.  However, with the increasing use of e-commerce, security and privacy issues have become a concern for consumers.  Here are some of the common security and privacy issues in e-commerce:Cybersecurity: Online transactions involve the exchange of sensitive information such as credit card details, personal information, and passwords.  Therefore, e-commerce sites need to have strong cybersecurity measures to prevent data breaches, hacking, and other cyber threats. Payment fraud: Payment fraud is a common issue in e-commerce, where fraudsters use stolen credit card information to make fraudulent purchases.  Online retailers need to have measures in place to detect and prevent payment fraud, such as fraud detection algorithms and multi-factor authentication. Privacy: Consumers are often hesitant to share their personal information online, as they fear it may be used for malicious purposes.  Therefore, e-commerce sites need to have clear privacy policies and ensure that consumers' personal information is secure and not shared with third parties without their consent. Phishing scams: Phishing scams are a common issue in e-commerce, where fraudsters send emails or messages that appear to be from legitimate retailers, asking for personal information or login credentials.

"In computer science, a backdoor is a hidden method of bypassing normal authentication or security controls in a system, allowing a user to gain unauthorized access to the system or its data.  A backdoor is usually created by the system's designer or developer as a means of accessing the system in case of an emergency or for troubleshooting purposes. However, backdoors can also be created maliciously by attackers to gain unauthorized access to a system or network.  Backdoors can be hidden in various parts of a system, including software applications, operating systems, and network infrastructure. Backdoors can be difficult to detect, as they are designed to remain hidden and bypass normal security controls.  However, they can be discovered through regular security audits, network monitoring, and analysis of system logs. Backdoors are considered a serious security threat, as they can allow attackers to access sensitive information, steal data, and carry out other malicious activities.  Preventing backdoors requires implementing strong security controls, such as access controls, authentication mechanisms, and encryption, and regularly monitoring and testing systems for vulnerabilities.",1,202,1201,8,95,0.47029702970297027,0.297029702970297,5.0594059405940595,25.25,14.824318181818171,16.657045454545457,19.70909090909091,17.410965686947208,15.677272727272726,0.3465346534653465,0.3106796116504854,0.11165048543689321,0.07281553398058252,0.02912621359223301,0.09223300970873786,0.06310679611650485,1,0.0049504950495049506,17,0,0,0,0,0.08415841584158416,2,2

"A floppy disk is a type of magnetic storage device that was widely used in the late 20th century to store and transfer data between computers.  Floppy disks were first introduced in the 1970s and were commonly used for data backup, software distribution, and file transfer. Floppy disks typically consisted of a flexible plastic disk coated with a magnetic material that could store data in the form of magnetized spots on the surface of the disk.

Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is used to periodically verify the identity of the peer using a 3-way handshake.  This isdone upon initial link establishment‚ and MAY be repeated anytime after thelink has been established. After the Link Establishment phase is complete‚ the authenticator sendsa “challenge” message to the peer which is a random byte-sequence as wellas the identifier‚ a randomly generated number.  The peer responds with avalue calculated using a “one-way hash” function.  The authenticator checksthe response against its own calculation of the expected hash value.  If thevalues match‚ the authentication is acknowledged; otherwise the connectionSHOULD be terminated. CHAP provides protection against playback attack through the use of anincrementally changing identifier and a variable challenge value.  The use ofrepeated challenges is intended to limit the time of exposure to any singleattack.  The authentication can occur between client and server‚ in largerinfrastructures‚ however‚ the administration of keys or passwords can bequite a big effort. CHAP also supports the use of central server that acts as a central certification unit according to such as‚ the Remote Access Dial-in User Serviceprinciple or is in control of the frequency and timing of the challenges.,0,207,1314,10,129,0.6231884057971014,0.48792270531400966,5.405797101449275,20.7,23.247894736842113,14.736842105263161,16.863157894736844,15.381575749822971,15.885263157894734,0.3719806763285024,0.23376623376623376,0.09956709956709957,0.05627705627705628,0.030303030303030304,0.09956709956709957,0.05627705627705628,14,0.06763285024154589,0,1,0,0,0,0.004830917874396135,1,1

"The basic building block of a Forth program is a word, which can be either a built-in primitive word or a user-defined word.  Words are defined using a combination of other words, which are arranged in a hierarchical structure.  The stack plays a central role in Forth programming, with data being pushed onto and popped off of the stack as needed by the program. Forth programs typically consist of a series of words that are executed in a specific order.  The structure of a Forth program is often represented as a tree, with the words forming the nodes of the tree and the data flowing through the branches. Forth has a simple syntax, with words being defined using a postfix notation.  This means that the arguments to a word come after the word itself, separated by spaces.  For example, to add two numbers in Forth, you would use the following syntax:2 3 +This code pushes the numbers 2 and 3 onto the stack, and then executes the addition operation using the + word.",1,190,973,8,96,0.5052631578947369,0.3526315789473684,4.189473684210526,23.75,61.063662790697705,10.083372093023254,12.088372093023256,11.20814326018867,8.923255813953489,0.41578947368421054,0.225,0.125,0.05,0.02,0.13,0.05,8,0.042105263157894736,9,0,1,0,0,0.04736842105263158,0,3
"The systems analyst serves as the bridge between the needs of the user and the capabilities of the computer system.  The systems analyst goes into action when users request that some new application or function be provided (usually in a corporate computing environment). The first step is to define the user’s requirements and to prepare precise specifications for the program.  In doing so, the systems analyst is aided by methodologies developed by computer scientists over the last several decades ,.  Often flowcharts or other aids are used to help visualize the operation of the program ,. After communicating with the user, the systems analyst must then communicate with the programmers, helping them understand what is needed and reviewing their work as they begin to design the program.  Although the systems analyst may do little actual programming, he or she must be familiar with programming tools and practices.  This may make it possible to suggest existing software or components that could be adapted instead of undertaking the cost and time involved with creating a new program.

"An interpreter is a program that analyzes (parses) program-ming commands or statements in a high-level language ,,  creates  equivalent  executable instructions in machine code , and executes them.  An interpreter differs from a compiler in that the lat-ter converts the entire program to an executable file rather than processing and executing it a statement at a time . many  earlier  versions  of  the  BASIC  programming  lan-guage  were  implemented  as  interpreters.   Since  an  inter-preter only has to hold one program statement at a time in memory, it could run on early microcomputers that had only a  few  tens  of  thousands  of  bytes  of  system  memory.   How-ever,  interpreters  run  programs  considerably  more  slowly than a compiled program would run.  One reason is that an interpreter “throws away” each source code statement after it  interprets  it.   This  means  that  if  a  statement  runs  repeat-edly ,, it must be re-interpreted each time it runs.  A  compiler,  on  the  other  hand,  would  create  only  one  set of  machine  code  instructions  for  the  loop  and  then  move on.   Also,  because  a  compiler  keeps  the  entire  program  in memory,  it  can  analyze  the  relationship  between  multiple statements  and  recognize  ways  to  rearrange  or  substitute them for greater efficiency.",0,221,1338,9,120,0.5429864253393665,0.3755656108597285,4.733031674208145,24.555555555555557,38.17818386914837,13.372047377326563,16.877382966723072,15.322241378113624,12.701522842639598,0.39819004524886875,0.19076923076923077,0.08923076923076922,0.046153846153846156,0.036923076923076927,0.06769230769230769,0.027692307692307693,5,0.02262443438914027,11,0,0,0,0,0.049773755656108594,0,0

"The hexadecimal system is a number system with a base of 16.  It is commonly used in computing and digital electronics, as it provides an efficient way to represent binary data.  In the hexadecimal system, each digit can have 16 different values, ranging from 0 to 9 and A to F. The first 10 digits in the hexadecimal system represent the numbers 0 to 9, while the letters A to F represent the numbers 10 to 15.  For example, the number 10 in hexadecimal is represented by the letter A, and the number 15 is represented by the letter F. To convert a hexadecimal number to a decimal number, each digit is multiplied by its corresponding power of 16 and then added together.  For example, the hexadecimal number 3B can be converted to decimal as follows:3B = (3 x 16^1) + (11 x 16^0)= (3 x 16) + (11 x 1)= 48 + 11= 59Similarly, to convert a decimal number to a hexadecimal number, the number is divided by 16 and the remainder is converted to a hexadecimal digit.  The process is repeated until the quotient becomes zero.  The resulting hexadecimal digits are written in reverse order to obtain the final hexadecimal number. For example, to convert the decimal number 210 to hexadecimal:210 ÷ 16 = 13 with a remainder of 213 ÷ 16 = 0 with a remainder of 13 (which is represented by the letter D)Therefore, 210 in hexadecimal is D2.",1,274,1329,8,105,0.38321167883211676,0.21897810218978103,3.9452554744525545,34.25,43.30250000000004,13.057553191489365,16.548936170212766,15.112257680678326,8.460425531914897,0.3722627737226277,0.19285714285714287,0.08571428571428572,0.05,0.014285714285714285,0.11071428571428571,0.05,33,0.12043795620437957,12,0,2,0,0,0.043795620437956206,1,0

"By itself, a Web page coded in HTML is simply a “static” display that does not interact with the user (other than for the selection of links).  (See html, dhtml, and xhtm. ) Many Web services, including online databases and e-commerce transactions, require that the user be able to interact with the server.  For example, an online shopper may need to browse or search a catalog of CD titles, select one or more for purchase, and then complete the transaction by providing credit card and other information.  These functions are provided by “gateway programs” on the server that can access databases or other facilities. One way to provide interaction with (and through) a Web page is to use the CGI (common gateway interface).

"The journey of the word processor can be traced back to the mid-1960s, when IBM developed the Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter (MT/ST).  This was the first commercially available word processing machine, and it used magnetic tape to store and edit text. In the 1970s, the first true word processors were developed.  These machines, such as the Wang 1200 and the Xerox Alto, used digital technology to store and edit text.  The Wang 1200 was one of the first word processors to feature a CRT display, which allowed users to see what they were typing as they typed it. By the 1980s, personal computers had become more powerful and affordable, and word processing software began to be developed for these machines.  Some of the early popular word processing software included WordStar, WordPerfect, and Microsoft Word. In the 1990s and early 2000s, word processing software became more advanced, with features such as spell-checking, grammar-checking, and desktop publishing tools.  The rise of the internet and email also led to the development of collaborative word processing software such as Google Docs and Microsoft Office 365. Today, word processors continue to evolve and adapt to the changing needs of users.  The software has become more user-friendly, with intuitive interfaces and features that make it easier to create and edit documents.

"In computer science, a stack is an abstract data type that represents a collection of elements, where the elements are stored and retrieved based on a last-in, first-out (LIFO) principle. This means that the most recently added element is the first one to be removed.  Think of a stack of plates; you can only remove the top plate, and to add another plate, it must be placed on top. A stack has two main operations: push and pop.  The push operation adds an element to the top of the stack, while the pop operation removes the most recently added element from the top of the stack.  Other operations on a stack can include peek, which retrieves the most recently added element without removing it, and is_empty, which checks if the stack contains any elements. Stacks are commonly used in programming, especially for implementing recursive algorithms, maintaining a history of function calls, and evaluating expressions.  They are also used in many other applications, such as compilers, operating systems, and web browsers.",1,197,1025,8,106,0.5380710659898477,0.38071065989847713,4.324873096446701,24.625,50.40389705882353,11.508088235294121,15.794117647058824,14.731742533061166,10.885882352941174,0.38578680203045684,0.23902439024390243,0.13170731707317074,0.05365853658536585,0.04878048780487805,0.08780487804878048,0.04878048780487805,3,0.015228426395939087,15,1,1,0,0,0.08121827411167512,0,2
"The role of computers in the film industry began in the 1970s with the advent of computer-generated imagery (CGI).  At that time, computers were used primarily to generate simple 2D graphics and effects, such as titles and special effects for TV commercials. In the 1980s, the capabilities of computers improved, and they began to be used for more complex 3D graphics and effects in films.  One of the first films to use computer-generated imagery extensively was ""Tron"" (1982), which used CGI to create the film's distinctive digital world. As the technology continued to improve, the use of CGI in films became more widespread, with films like ""Jurassic Park"" (1993) and ""The Matrix"" (1999) using advanced CGI to create realistic creatures and special effects. Today, computers play a vital role in nearly every aspect of the film industry, from pre-production to post-production.  They are used to create and edit scripts, design sets and costumes, film and edit footage, and create special effects and visual effects.  Additionally, computers are used for marketing and distribution, such as creating trailers and promoting films on social media and streaming platforms.",1,222,1174,8,106,0.4774774774774775,0.32432432432432434,4.468468468468468,27.75,41.14366554054058,13.265506756756757,15.952702702702704,14.554592549557764,12.547027027027024,0.31981981981981983,0.2777777777777778,0.10256410256410256,0.07264957264957266,0.02564102564102564,0.10256410256410256,0.021367521367521368,15,0.06756756756756757,14,0,0,0,0,0.06306306306306306,0,1
"An applet is a small, lightweight Java program that is intended to be run within a web browser.  Applets are embedded in HTML pages and can be executed within a web browser's Java Virtual Machine (JVM).  They are often used to provide interactive and dynamic content, such as animations, games, and other graphical user interface (GUI) elements.  The applets are typically written in Java, a programming language that is known for its platform independence, meaning that the same Java applet can run on different operating systems and devices.  This makes applets ideal for creating web-based applications that can be accessed from any device with a web browser and a JVM.  Applets are usually restricted in terms of the resources they can access and the actions they can perform, for security reasons.  This helps prevent malicious applets from accessing sensitive information on the user's computer or from performing harmful actions.  Applets have been largely replaced by alternative technologies such as JavaServer Pages (JSP), JavaServer Faces (JSF), and JavaScript, which offer greater flexibility and better performance for web-based applications.

"In computing, a demon (sometimes spelled daemon) is a computer program or process that runs in the background and performs specific tasks or services without requiring user intervention.  Demons are typically used in operating systems and network servers to manage resources, monitor system performance, and provide various types of services. One of the key characteristics of a demon is that it runs continuously in the background, waiting for specific events or conditions to occur before it executes a particular task.  For example, a network demon might monitor network traffic and respond to specific types of requests, such as file transfers or email messages.  A system demon might manage system resources such as memory or disk space, or perform regular maintenance tasks such as backups or system updates. Demons are often associated with Unix and Unix-like operating systems, where they are managed by the system's init process.  In these systems, demons are typically started at boot time and run continuously until the system is shut down or the demon is explicitly stopped. The term ""demon"" is sometimes used interchangeably with the term ""service"" or ""background process"".  However, in some contexts, ""demon"" specifically refers to a program or process that runs continuously and provides a specific type of service or functionality, while ""service"" may refer more generally to any program or process that provides a service or function on a computer system.",1,264,1472,9,123,0.4659090909090909,0.29545454545454547,4.7272727272727275,29.333333333333332,31.926545893719805,15.154927536231884,17.004830917874397,15.172626615295595,13.37826086956522,0.3484848484848485,0.3062730627306273,0.0996309963099631,0.04428044280442804,0.05166051660516605,0.0959409594095941,0.04428044280442804,2,0.007575757575757576,12,0,0,0,0,0.045454545454545456,1,0

"Computer-related businesses are heavily impacted by the effects of globalization, as they operate in a global marketplace that is increasingly interconnected and competitive.  Here are some ways in which computer-related businesses deal with the effects of globalization:Internationalization: Many computer-related businesses seek to expand their operations globally, by entering new markets and developing international partnerships.  This involves adapting their products and services to meet the needs of different cultures and languages, as well as complying with local regulations and laws. Outsourcing: Globalization has led to the outsourcing of many computer-related jobs to countries where labor is cheaper, such as India and China.  This allows businesses to reduce costs and increase efficiency, but it also raises ethical and social concerns about the impact on local workers and economies. Competition: Globalization has led to increased competition in the computer industry, as businesses from different countries compete for customers and market share.  This has led to rapid innovation and development, but it also presents challenges for businesses that must keep up with changing technologies and market trends. Supply chain management: Many computer-related businesses rely on complex global supply chains to manufacture and distribute their products.

"The history of handwriting recognition systems dates back to the 1960s, when researchers began to develop algorithms to recognize handwritten characters and symbols.  One of the earliest systems was developed at IBM, which used pattern recognition techniques to recognize handwritten digits. In the following decades, researchers continued to refine handwriting recognition algorithms, and by the 1980s, commercial handwriting recognition systems began to appear.  These early systems were limited in their accuracy and were mostly used in specialized applications such as check processing. The introduction of personal digital assistants (PDAs) in the 1990s and the increasing use of tablet computers and smartphones in the 2000s led to renewed interest in handwriting recognition technology.  By the early 2000s, handwriting recognition software had become widely available on mobile devices, allowing users to input text using a stylus or their finger.",1,152,955,6,90,0.5921052631578947,0.45394736842105265,5.368421052631579,25.333333333333332,21.251867396593724,15.967554744525547,19.352311435523117,18.243605946275583,16.81459854014599,0.32894736842105265,0.3032258064516129,0.13548387096774195,0.08387096774193549,0.01935483870967742,0.10967741935483871,0.025806451612903226,8,0.05263157894736842,7,0,0,0,0,0.046052631578947366,0,1

"The smart card is the next generation of transaction devices.  Magnetically coded credit, debit, and ATM cards have been in use for many years.  These cards contain a magnetic strip encoded with a small amount of fixed data to identify the account.  All the actual data (such as account balances) is kept in a central server, which is why credit cards must be validated and transactions approved through a phone (modem) link.  Some magnetic strip cards such as those used in rapid transit systems are rewritable, so that, for example, the fare for the current ride can be deducted.  Telephone cards work the same way.  Nevertheless, these cards are essentially passive tokens containing a small amount of data.  They have little flexibility.

"Design patterns are an attempt to abstract and generalize what is learned in solving one problem so that it can be applied to future similar problems.  The idea was first applied to architecture by Christopher Alexander in his book A Pattern Language.  Alexander described a pattern as a description of situations in which a particular problem occurs, with a solution that takes into account the factors that are “invariant” (not changed by context).  Guidance for applying the solution is also provided. For example, a bus stop, a waiting room, and a line at a theme park are all places where people wait.  A “place to wait” pattern would specify the problem to be solved (how to make waiting as pleasant as possible) and suggest solutions.  Patterns can have different levels of abstraction or scales on which they apply (for example, an intimate theater and a stadium are both places of entertainment, but one is much larger than the other). Patterns in turn are linked into a network called a pattern language.  Thus when working with one pattern, the designer is guided to consider related patterns.  For example, a pattern for a room might relate to patterns for seating or grouping the occupants.",0,230,1203,10,126,0.5478260869565217,0.3826086956521739,4.326086956521739,23.0,51.47457425742576,11.097900990099014,13.426534653465348,13.187427743715652,10.5,0.41739130434782606,0.22362869198312235,0.11814345991561181,0.046413502109704644,0.02531645569620253,0.11392405063291139,0.06751054852320675,7,0.030434782608695653,8,0,0,0,0,0.034782608695652174,1,2

"The development of optical fiber technology can be traced back to the early 20th century, when scientists and engineers began to explore the use of light to transmit information over long distances. In the 1920s and 1930s, researchers began to investigate the properties of glass and other transparent materials as potential transmission media for light.  They discovered that light could be guided along a thin glass fiber by reflecting off the walls of the fiber, and that this process, called total internal reflection, could be used to transmit information. In the 1950s and 1960s, researchers in the United States and Europe made significant advances in the development of fiber optics technology.  They developed new manufacturing techniques to produce high-quality glass fibers with low attenuation (loss of signal strength), and they developed new methods for connecting fibers together and transmitting light signals over long distances. In the 1970s and 1980s, the development of new types of lasers and other light sources made it possible to transmit signals over much longer distances and at much higher data rates.  This led to the widespread adoption of fiber optic technology in telecommunications and other applications. Today, optical fiber technology is used in a wide range of applications, including telecommunications, networking, medical equipment, and sensing technologies.  It has revolutionized the way we communicate and share information, enabling high-speed data transmission and communication over long distances with unprecedented reliability and efficiency.",1,260,1589,9,133,0.5115384615384615,0.35384615384615387,5.196153846153846,28.88888888888889,20.132222222222254,16.938014184397165,20.486997635933808,18.12316971661352,15.743829787234041,0.3423076923076923,0.30223880597014924,0.1044776119402985,0.11567164179104478,0.018656716417910446,0.11567164179104478,0.029850746268656716,9,0.03461538461538462,14,0,0,0,0,0.05384615384615385,0,5

"Netnews, also known as Usenet, is a distributed online discussion system that allows users to read and post messages in public discussion forums called newsgroups.  Each newsgroup is dedicated to a specific topic, and users can browse, search, and participate in discussions related to that topic.  Here are the key features and structures of netnews and newsgroups:Hierarchy: Newsgroups are organized into a hierarchical structure that starts with major categories such as ""comp"" for computer-related discussions, ""sci"" for science-related discussions, ""soc"" for social discussions, and ""rec"" for recreational discussions.  Each major category is further divided into subcategories that reflect more specific topics. Message posting: Users can post messages to newsgroups by composing a message in their newsreader software and submitting it to a news server.  The message is then distributed to all servers that subscribe to that particular newsgroup. Message threading: Netnews uses a threading system that groups related messages together in a tree-like structure.  Users can easily follow the conversation by viewing messages in the order they were posted and seeing how they relate to each other. Subscription: Users can subscribe to newsgroups that interest them, and their newsreader software will download all new messages in those newsgroups automatically. Moderation: Some newsgroups are moderated by volunteers who review messages before they are posted to ensure they are relevant and appropriate for the newsgroup's topic.  Moderators can also remove messages that violate the group's rules. Archives: Netnews messages are archived on news servers, and users can search through archives to find old messages or topics of interest. Distribution: Netnews messages are distributed across a network of news servers, which synchronize with each other to ensure that all messages are available to all users. In summary, netnews and newsgroups offer a decentralized, distributed system for online discussion and information sharing, with a hierarchical structure, message threading, subscriptions, and archives.  While netnews and newsgroups have been largely superseded by other online communication platforms, they remain an important part of the early history of the internet and online communities.",1,387,2309,15,164,0.42377260981912146,0.27648578811369506,5.10594315245478,25.8,29.36129353233835,14.712238805970149,16.933333333333334,15.470042427545799,16.012537313432833,0.37209302325581395,0.275,0.1225,0.0675,0.025,0.1025,0.055,3,0.007751937984496124,18,0,8,0,0,0.046511627906976744,0,1

The following are the main functionalities of web browsers:Rendering: A web browser reads the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code in a web page and uses it to display the content of the page on the user's device.  This process is called rendering. Navigation: Web browsers allow users to navigate through the web by following hyperlinks and entering URLs.  They also provide a back button, which allows users to return to previously visited pages. Security: Web browsers have security features that protect users from online threats such as phishing scams, malware, and malicious websites.  For example, web browsers may display warnings when a user visits a suspicious website or block downloads from untrusted sources. Extensions: Many web browsers allow users to install extensions, which are small software programs that add extra functionality to the browser.  Examples of extensions include ad blockers, password managers, and productivity tools. Bookmarks: Web browsers allow users to save bookmarks, which are links to frequently visited web pages.  Bookmarks make it easy for users to quickly access their favorite websites. History: Web browsers keep a record of the websites that users have visited, which is known as browsing history.  Users can use their browsing history to revisit pages that they have previously visited. Tabs: Web browsers allow users to open multiple tabs, which are separate instances of the browser window.  Tabs make it easy for users to switch between different web pages without having to open multiple windows.

"""Cyberpunk"" is a term that originated in the science fiction genre and refers to a subgenre of science fiction that often focuses on a dystopian future where technology has advanced to the point of becoming an integral part of society, but has also brought about significant social and cultural changes. Cyberpunk typically features protagonists who are hackers, rebels, or outcasts who use advanced technology and their skills to navigate the often corrupt and oppressive society they live in.  The genre is often characterized by a dark, gritty aesthetic, and themes of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and the blurring of boundaries between human and machine. In recent years, ""cyberpunk"" has also become associated with a broader cultural movement that draws inspiration from the genre's themes and aesthetic.  This can include fashion, music, and other forms of art that incorporate elements of cyberpunk into their design and presentation.",1,166,954,5,99,0.5963855421686747,0.43373493975903615,4.885542168674699,33.2,21.9038493150685,17.458273972602743,20.173150684931507,17.58133193835471,14.45068493150685,0.3795180722891566,0.2619047619047619,0.08928571428571429,0.10714285714285714,0.03571428571428571,0.1130952380952381,0.047619047619047616,1,0.006024096385542169,10,0,0,0,0,0.060240963855421686,0,2
"pronounced AL-go-rith-um is a procedure or formula for solving a problem.  The word derives from the name of the mathematician, Mohammed ibn-Musa al-Khwarizmi, who was part of the royal court in Baghdad and who lived from about 780 to 850.  Al-Khwarizmi’s work is the likely source for the word algebra as well.  Algorithm is any well-defined procedure (does not have to be computa tional) that takes some value or set of values as input and produces some value or set of values as output.  It is a technique that comes with a guarantee.  The technique for ratio nal function integration is an algorithm because it always produces the an swer, without exception.  Differentiation is an algorithm—given an elemen tary function, you can always find its derivative.  Algorithms can be fast or slow, but the important thing is the guarantee.  In some sense, an algorithm is a ‘predictable heuristic,’ whereby one cannot tell if a heuristic will work, before one tries it, but one knows in advance what the output of an algorithm will be.  In computing terms, algorithm is a sequence of computational steps that transform the input to the output.  A computer program can be viewed as an elaborate algorithm.  In mathe matics and computer science, an algorithm usually means a small procedure that solves a recurrent problem.  In this context the term Virus Algorithm means a set of operations or a procedure designed to create a virus problem.  In the context of Digital Signatures or Encryption, the algorithm describes how the signature or text is encrypted using mathematical formulas Another example is the Condensation algorithm (Conditional Density Propagation) that allows quite general representations of probability.  The simplicity of the Condensation algorithm also allows the use of non-linear motion models more complex than those commonly used in Kalman filters.  Using the statistical technique of importance sampling it is possible to build a Condensation tracker which runs in real time tracking a dancer or a hand as they move",0,364,2039,16,183,0.5027472527472527,0.3626373626373626,4.65934065934066,22.75,38.87834821428575,12.94487651975684,16.249316109422494,15.078166124597352,11.901519756838905,0.42032967032967034,0.21662468513853905,0.09319899244332494,0.05793450881612091,0.030226700251889168,0.08312342569269521,0.060453400503778336,15,0.04120879120879121,12,0,0,0,0,0.03296703296703297,0,9
"The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system that translates human-readable domain names into IP addresses, which are the numerical addresses that computers use to identify each other on the internet.  DNS allows users to access websites and other resources using easy-to-remember domain names, rather than having to remember the numerical IP addresses. When a user enters a domain name into a web browser, the browser sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.  The DNS server then looks up the IP address associated with the domain name and returns it to the browser, which can then connect to the appropriate server to access the website or other resource. DNS is hierarchical and distributed, with a global network of DNS servers that work together to resolve domain names.  At the top of the hierarchy are the root servers, which store information about the top-level domain names (such as . com, . org, and . net).

"SOAP stands for Simple Object Access Protocol.  It is a messaging protocol used for exchanging structured information between networked applications.  SOAP is a widely used protocol for web services and is often used in enterprise applications. SOAP messages are typically sent using XML (Extensible Markup Language) and can be transmitted over a variety of transport protocols, such as HTTP, SMTP, or JMS.  A SOAP message consists of a header and a body.  The header contains information about the message, such as the encoding used and any security information, while the body contains the actual data being exchanged. One of the key benefits of SOAP is that it allows applications running on different platforms and written in different programming languages to communicate with each other.  This is because SOAP is based on open standards and is independent of any particular platform or programming language. SOAP is often used in enterprise applications, such as those used for financial transactions or supply chain management, where security and reliability are critical.  However, it can be more complex and slower than other web services protocols like REST, which is more commonly used for modern web applications.",1,212,1225,10,111,0.5235849056603774,0.3443396226415094,4.85377358490566,21.2,36.40870942408381,12.926015706806286,16.226387434554976,15.112257680678326,13.259685863874346,0.3915094339622642,0.21559633027522937,0.10091743119266056,0.09174311926605505,0.03669724770642202,0.11009174311926606,0.07339449541284404,6,0.02830188679245283,9,0,0,0,0,0.04245283018867924,1,0
"Because of its many practical features and its availability for the popular IBM 360 mainframes, PL/I enjoyed considerable success in the late 1960s and 1970s.  The language was later ported to most major platforms and operating systems.  When personal computers came along, PL/I became available for IBM’s OS/2 operating system as well as for Microsoft’s DOS and Windows, although the language never really caught on in those environments. Computer scientists such as structured programming guru Edsger Dijkstra decried PL/I’s lack of a clear, welldefined structure.  In his Turing Award Lecture in 1972, Dijkstra opined that “I absolutely fail to see how we can keep our growing programs firmly within our intellectual grip when by its sheer baroqueness the programming language—our basic tool, mind you!—already escapes our intellectual control. ” (See Dijkstra, Edsger. )On a practical level the sheer number of features in the language meant that truly mastering it was a lengthy process.  A language like C, on the other hand, had a much simpler “core” to master even though it was less versatile.  PL/I also tended to retain the mainframe associations from its birth at IBM, while C grew up in the world of minicomputers and the UNIX community and proved more suitable for PCs.  Nevertheless, PL/I provided many examples that language designers could use in attempting to design better implementations.",0,256,1408,10,159,0.62109375,0.484375,4.61328125,25.6,42.50788564376799,12.321472645002057,14.009214315096669,13.023866798666859,12.697737556561094,0.3359375,0.17843866171003717,0.09665427509293681,0.09665427509293681,0.05204460966542751,0.10408921933085502,0.01858736059479554,13,0.05078125,11,0,0,1,0,0.046875,0,2

"These general principles also apply to systems where more than one processor is available ,, but there is the added complication of deciding where the scheduling program will be run.  In a multiprocessing system that has one “master” and many “slave” processors, the scheduling program runs on the master processor.  This arrangement is simple, but it means that when a slave processor wants to schedule a program it must wait until the scheduling program gets its next time-slice on the master processor. One alternative is to allow any processor that has free time to run the scheduling algorithm.  This is harder to set up because it requires a mechanism to make sure two processors do not try to run the scheduling program at the same time, but it smoothes out the bottleneck that would arise from relying on a single processor.",0,154,832,5,86,0.5584415584415584,0.4025974025974026,4.474025974025974,30.8,43.659285714285744,14.125714285714285,18.342857142857145,16.15616582465906,11.065714285714286,0.44155844155844154,0.2389937106918239,0.13836477987421383,0.06918238993710692,0.006289308176100629,0.06918238993710692,0.05660377358490566,4,0.025974025974025976,5,0,0,0,0,0.032467532467532464,0,2
"Phishing is a type of cybercrime where an attacker tries to trick individuals into revealing sensitive information like passwords, credit card numbers, or personal identification numbers.  Here are some ways to prevent phishing:Be cautious of emails and messages: Do not open any attachments or click on any links in emails or messages that appear suspicious.  Always verify the sender's email address and check for any spelling or grammatical errors. Keep your software updated: Always keep your software and operating system up to date with the latest security patches and updates.  This can help protect against known vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. Use anti-phishing tools: Use anti-phishing tools provided by your web browser or email client, which can help identify and block phishing attempts. Use strong passwords: Use strong, unique passwords for each online account, and avoid using the same password across multiple accounts.  Consider using a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. Educate yourself: Stay informed about the latest phishing techniques and common scams.  Be wary of any messages or emails that ask for personal information. Enable two-factor authentication: Use two-factor authentication for all accounts that support it.  This adds an extra layer of security to your accounts by requiring a second factor, such as a fingerprint or code generated on your phone, to log in. Be skeptical of unsolicited offers: Be skeptical of any unsolicited offers or requests, especially those that seem too good to be true.  Avoid providing personal information unless you are sure that the request is legitimate.

"The Domain Name System (DNS) is the Internet's system for mapping alphabetic names to numeric Internet Protocol (IP) addresses like a phone book maps a person's name to a phone number.  For example, when a Web address (URL) is typed into a browser, a DNS query is made to learn an IP address of a Web server associated with that name. Using the www. example. com URL, example. com is the domain name, and www is the hostname.  DNS resolution maps www. example. com into an IP address (such as 192. 0. 2. 1).  When a user needs to load a webpage, a conversion must occur between what a user types into their web browser (www. example. com) into an IP address required to locate the www. example. com site. The DNS system is an open worldwide network of database name servers that include 13 authoritative name servers that serve the DNS root zone level, known as ""root servers"".  A root server (also called a DNS root nameserver) receives a DNS query that includes a domain name (e. g.  www. thousandeyes. com), and responds by directing that request to a top-level domain (TLD) nameserver, based on the TLD of that domain such as . com, . net, and . org.  It directly responds to requests for DNS records in the root zone by returning an appropriate list of the authoritative TLD name servers for the appropriate TLD that can resolve the initial DNS lookup request for an IP address of that domain name.",0,305,1403,25,116,0.380327868852459,0.22950819672131148,3.760655737704918,12.2,61.76936923076924,9.421200000000002,12.012307692307694,11.362043627235082,7.879200000000001,0.29508196721311475,0.28753993610223644,0.07348242811501597,0.03514376996805112,0.006389776357827476,0.08945686900958466,0.025559105431309903,23,0.07540983606557378,10,0,0,0,0,0.03278688524590164,0,1

"As millions of people became new computer users during the 1980s, a thriving computer book publishing industry offered users a more user-friendly approach than that usually provided in the manuals issued by the software companies.  The “Dummies” books, offering bite-sized servings of information written in a breezy style and accompanied by cartoons, eventually spread beyond computers into hundreds of other fields and the format was then copied by other publishers.  Publishers such as Sams, Coriolis, and particularly O’Reilly have aimed their offerings at more experienced users, programmers, and multimedia developers. Computer trade books are often written by experienced developers and systems programmers who can offer advanced knowledge and “tips and tricks” to their less experienced colleagues.  Since many technical “gurus” are not experienced writers, the best results often come from collaboration between the expert and an experienced technical writer and/or editor who can review the material for completeness, organization, and clarity.

"Parallel ports are a type of communication interface that allows data to be transmitted between a computer and a peripheral device.  They were commonly used in older computers to connect printers, scanners, and other external devices. A parallel port typically consists of a 25-pin female connector on the computer, and a matching male connector on the peripheral device.  The data is transmitted in parallel, meaning that multiple bits of data are sent at the same time over separate wires. Parallel ports were popular because they allowed for relatively fast data transfer rates, especially compared to older serial ports.  However, they have largely been replaced by newer and faster interfaces, such as USB and Ethernet.

"The psychology of computing is a field of study that focuses on the psychological processes involved in human-computer interaction.  It seeks to understand how people perceive, process, and interact with computer technology, and how these interactions affect their behavior, cognition, and emotions. One of the key areas of study in the psychology of computing is human-computer interaction (HCI).  HCI researchers seek to understand how people interact with computer technology, and how technology can be designed to better support human needs and capabilities.  This involves studying factors such as user interface design, usability, user experience, and cognitive load. Another important area of study in the psychology of computing is the impact of technology on human cognition and behavior.  Researchers in this field examine how computer technology affects attention, memory, learning, decision-making, and social behavior.  They also explore the impact of technology on mental health and well-being, and the potential risks and benefits of technology use. The psychology of computing is a multidisciplinary field that draws on theories and methods from psychology, computer science, engineering, design, and other related disciplines.

"The history of basic programming languages dates back to the mid-1960s.  Early computer programming languages were designed to be easy to use and understand, making them accessible to a wider range of people.  The first basic programming language was FORTRAN (Formula Translation), which was developed in the mid-1950s and used primarily for scientific and engineering applications.  In 1964, John Kemeny and Thomas Kurtz at Dartmouth College created BASIC (Beginners All-purpose Symbolic Instruction Code), which was designed to be easy to learn and use for beginners.  BASIC was widely adopted and became popular among hobbyist and amateur computer users.  In the late 1960s and early 1970s, other basic programming languages were developed, including COBOL (Common Business-Oriented Language), used for business applications, and Pascal, used for teaching programming concepts.  These languages set the foundation for modern programming and helped make programming more accessible and user-friendly.  Over the years, basic programming languages have evolved to include more advanced features, making them suitable for a wider range of applications, but their simplicity and accessibility continue to be their defining characteristics.",1,202,1237,8,104,0.5148514851485149,0.3415841584158416,5.2227722772277225,25.25,25.399318181818188,15.182045454545456,19.481818181818184,17.267425705330172,16.600000000000005,0.31683168316831684,0.19534883720930232,0.12558139534883722,0.10232558139534884,0.023255813953488372,0.07906976744186046,0.046511627906976744,16,0.07920792079207921,12,0,0,0,0,0.0594059405940594,0,0

"Simulations and simulation techniques are used for a tremendous range of applications today.  Besides helping with the understanding of natural systems in physics, chemistry, biology, or engineering, simulation techniques are also applied to human behavior.  For example, the behavior of consumers or traders in a stock market can be explored with a simulation based on game theory concepts.  Artificial intelligence techniques (such as expert systems) can be used to give the individual “actors” in a simulation more realistic behavior. Simulations are often used in training.  A modern flight simulator, for example, not only simulates the aerodynamics of a plane and its response to the environment and to control inputs, but detailed graphics (and simulated physical motion) can make such training simulations feel very realistic, if not quite to Star Trek holodeck standards.  Whether for flight, military exercises, or stock trading, simulations can provide a much wider range of experiences in a relatively short time than would be feasible (or safe) using the real-world activity.  Simulations can also play an important part in testing software or systems or in predicating the results of business decisions or strategies. Simulations are also frequently sold as entertainment.  Many commercial strategy and role-playing games as well as vehicle simulators contain surprisingly complex simulations that make the games both absorbing and challenging ,.  Such games can also have considerable educational value.",0,256,1518,11,141,0.55078125,0.41796875,5.0234375,23.272727272727273,24.141801948051977,14.950925324675325,18.324025974025975,16.24694786949722,15.164285714285715,0.33984375,0.29850746268656714,0.07835820895522388,0.09701492537313433,0.055970149253731345,0.09701492537313433,0.05223880597014925,2,0.0078125,13,0,0,0,0,0.05078125,0,4

"Computing has revolutionized the way we live and work, but it also comes with risks.  Here are some of the main risks associated with computing:Cybersecurity threats: With the rise of the internet, cyber threats have become a major concern for individuals and organizations alike.  Cyberattacks such as malware, phishing, and ransomware can compromise the security of computer systems and result in data theft, financial loss, and reputational damage. Data privacy concerns: The increasing amount of personal and sensitive data stored and transmitted via computing systems has raised concerns about data privacy.  Unauthorized access to this data can result in identity theft, financial fraud, and other malicious activities. Software vulnerabilities: Software vulnerabilities, such as bugs and coding errors, can be exploited by attackers to gain unauthorized access to computer systems or data.  These vulnerabilities can also result in system crashes and other issues. Dependence on technology: As we become more dependent on computing technology, we become more vulnerable to the consequences of its failure.  For example, a power outage or system failure can result in significant disruptions to business operations, critical services, and public safety. Technology addiction: Computing technology can be addictive, leading to issues such as decreased productivity, social isolation, and mental health problems. To mitigate these risks, it's important to implement appropriate security measures, such as strong passwords, firewalls, antivirus software, and regular software updates.  Individuals and organizations should also practice good cybersecurity hygiene, such as being cautious of suspicious emails, avoiding public Wi-Fi networks, and backing up important data.  Additionally, it's important to balance our reliance on computing technology with a healthy lifestyle and social interactions.",1,316,1903,13,154,0.4873417721518987,0.3227848101265823,5.155063291139241,24.307692307692307,15.132026406429418,16.270149253731343,18.246153846153845,16.385398648044777,16.97985074626865,0.3227848101265823,0.2953846153846154,0.09538461538461539,0.11384615384615385,0.024615384615384615,0.10153846153846154,0.04923076923076923,3,0.00949367088607595,26,0,6,0,0,0.08227848101265822,0,5
"A system administrator is the person responsible for managing the operations of a computer facility to ensure that it runs properly, meets user needs, and protects the integrity of users’ data.  Such facilities range from offices with just a few users to large campus or corporate facilities that may be served by a large staff of administrators. The system administrator’s responsibilities often include:, setting up accounts for new users, allocating computing resources (such as server space) among users, configuring the file, database, or local area network (LAN) servers, installing new or upgraded software on users’ workstations, keeping up with new versions of the operating system and networking software, using various tools to monitor the performance of the system and to identify potential problems such as device “bottlenecks” or a shortage of disk space, ensuring that regular backups are made, configuring network services such as e-mail, Internet access, and the intranet (local TCP/IP network), using tools such as firewalls and virus scanners to protect the system from viruses, hacker attacks, and other security threats ,, providing user orientation and training, creating and documenting policies and procedures",0,219,1233,3,125,0.5707762557077626,0.4246575342465753,4.7853881278538815,73.0,-15.422681159420279,30.647391304347824,34.31594202898551,25.254471183327073,15.617391304347827,0.3150684931506849,0.3273542600896861,0.1210762331838565,0.08520179372197309,0.013452914798206279,0.09865470852017937,0.017937219730941704,1,0.0045662100456621,20,0,1,0,0,0.091324200913242,0,0
"many  services  today  use  the  popular  BitTorrent  file-shar-ing protocol.  A BitTorrent client (either the program of that name  or  another  compatible  one)  can  transmit  or  receive any  type  of  data.   To  share  a  file,  the  client  creates  a  “tor-rent”—a  small  file  that  contains  metadata  describing  the file and an assignment to a “tracker. ” The tracker is another computer  (node)  that  coordinates  the  distribution  of  the file.  Although this sounds complicated and a request takes longer  to  set  up  than  an  ordinary  HTTP  connection,  the advantage  is  that  once  set  up,  downloading  is  efficiently managed  even  for  files  for  which  there  is  high  demand.  The  downloading  client  connects  to  multiple  clients  that provide  pieces  of  the  desired  file.   Because  of  its  efficiency, BitTorrent allows for distribution of substantial amounts of data  at  low  cost,  particularly  since  the  system  “scales  up” automatically  without  having  to  provide  extra  resources.  BitTorrent  is  currently  being  used  for  a  variety  of  legally distributed  material,  including  video,  sound,  and  textual content",0,190,1182,8,112,0.5894736842105263,0.4473684210526316,4.731578947368421,23.75,33.33481707317074,13.70256097560976,17.46829268292683,15.903189008614273,13.524390243902438,0.3473684210526316,0.1382636655948553,0.08038585209003216,0.04180064308681672,0.02572347266881029,0.06430868167202572,0.022508038585209004,7,0.03684210526315789,8,0,0,0,0,0.042105263157894736,0,5

"Tape drives have long been a popular backup device due to their reliability, cost-effectiveness, and large storage capacities.  Here are some key points to keep in mind about using tape drives as a backup device:Large storage capacity: Tape drives can store large amounts of data, often up to multiple terabytes per tape.  This makes them an ideal choice for backing up large data sets, such as databases, file servers, or multimedia content. Cost-effectiveness: Compared to other backup devices like hard disk drives or solid-state drives, tape drives are generally more cost-effective, especially at scale.  Tapes themselves are relatively inexpensive, and the cost per gigabyte of storage is typically lower than other media types. Portability: Tapes are easy to transport and store offsite, making them a good option for disaster recovery scenarios or situations where data needs to be restored in a different location. Durability: Tapes are designed to be durable and can withstand extreme temperatures and humidity levels.  This makes them a good option for long-term data storage and archiving. Compatibility: Tape drives are compatible with a wide range of backup software and operating systems, making them a flexible option for different backup environments. However, there are some drawbacks to using tape drives as a backup device.  One of the main concerns is the slow read/write speeds of tape drives compared to other backup technologies.  Additionally, restoring data from tape can be a time-consuming process, especially for large data sets.  Finally, tapes can also be susceptible to damage or degradation over time, which can lead to data loss or corruption if not properly maintained.",1,300,1704,13,152,0.5066666666666667,0.37,4.78,23.076923076923077,39.77496503496505,12.75651515151515,14.789743589743592,14.106358169646779,13.324242424242424,0.3333333333333333,0.3052959501557632,0.06853582554517133,0.1277258566978193,0.040498442367601244,0.1059190031152648,0.059190031152647975,2,0.006666666666666667,16,0,6,0,0,0.05333333333333334,1,3

Implementing error correction can make failure recoverable, but slows data access down because data has to be read from more than one location and compared. The most commonly used RAID levels are:, RAID 0—striping data across disks, higher speed but no error correction; failure of any disk can make data unrecoverable, RAID 1—mirroring (data stored on at least two disks), data intact as long as one disk is still operating, RAID 3 and 4—striping plus a dedicated disk for parity (error checking), RAID 5—striping with distributed parity; data can be restored automatically after a failed disk is replaced, RAID 6—like RAID 5 but with parity distributed so that data remains intact unless more than two drives failIn actuality, RAID configurations can be very complex, where different levels can be “layered” above one another, with each treating the next as a virtual drive, until one gets down to the actual hardware.  Although RAID is often implemented using a physical (hardware) controller, operating systems can also create a virtual RAID structure in software, interposed between the logical drive as seen by the read/write routines and the physical drives.",0,272,1477,5,141,0.5183823529411765,0.33088235294117646,4.5661764705882355,54.4,17.20466952789701,22.43636051502146,24.648583690987124,19.083932058031824,13.31158798283262,0.3088235294117647,0.20761245674740483,0.13494809688581316,0.08304498269896193,0.04844290657439446,0.0726643598615917,0.06228373702422145,7,0.025735294117647058,20,2,2,0,0,0.08088235294117647,0,3
"The architecture of grid computing typically consists of several layers that work together to manage and coordinate resources across a network of computers.  The following are the main layers of a typical grid computing architecture:Resource Layer: This layer includes the individual computers or nodes that make up the grid network.  Each node contributes resources such as processing power, storage, and memory to the grid.  Nodes may vary in their capabilities and configurations, and may be connected to the grid intermittently or permanently. Fabric Layer: This layer provides the infrastructure to manage and coordinate the resources of the grid.  It includes software and hardware components such as network switches, routers, and firewalls that enable communication and data exchange between nodes. Middleware Layer: This layer provides the software framework that enables applications to access and utilize the resources of the grid.  It includes middleware components such as resource managers, schedulers, and security systems that ensure efficient and secure resource allocation and utilization. Application Layer: This layer includes the applications or services that run on the grid and use its resources to perform computational tasks.  Applications may be scientific simulations, data analytics, or other types of processing-intensive tasks that require significant computing resources.

"An interpreter is a computer program that translates and executes code written in a high-level programming language.  Unlike a compiler, which translates the entire program into machine code before executing it, an interpreter executes the code line by line, as it is encountered in the program. As the interpreter executes each line of code, it converts the code into machine-readable instructions that can be executed by the computer's CPU.  This process is known as interpretation, and it allows developers to test and debug their code quickly and easily, without the need to compile the entire program each time a change is made. Interpreters are commonly used in scripting languages, such as Python and Ruby, which are designed to be easy to learn and use.  They are also used in languages such as JavaScript and PHP, which are commonly used in web development, as they can be executed directly in a web browser or on a web server. One disadvantage of using an interpreter is that it can be slower than using a compiler, as the interpreter must execute each line of code as it is encountered.

"A class is a data type that combines both a data structure and methods for manipulating the data.  For example, a string class might consist of an array to hold the characters in the string and methods to compare strings, combine strings, or extract portions of a string ,. As with other data types, once a class is declared, objects (sometimes called instances) of the class can be created and used.  This way of structuring programs is called object-oriented programming because the class object is the basic building block ,. Object-oriented programming and classes provide several advantages over traditional block-structured languages.  In a traditional BASIC or even Pascal program, there is no particular connection between the data structure and the procedures or functions that manipulate it.  In a large program one programmer might change the data structure without alerting other programmers whose code assumes the original structure.  On the other hand, someone might write a procedure that directly manipulates the internal data rather than using the methods already provided.

"By the mid-1990s, Intel was promoting a standard for the automated detection and configuration of devices.  Known as Plug and Play (PnP), this standard was incorporated in versions of Microsoft Windows starting with Windows 95 ,.  The required hardware support soon appeared on PC motherboards and expansion cards. With Plug and Play the user simply connects a printer, scanner, or other device to the PC.  Windows detects that a device has been connected and queries it for its official name and other information.  If necessary, Windows can then prompt the user for a disk containing the appropriate driver or even search for a driver on a Web site. The concept of Plug and Play extends beyond the Windows world, however.  In recent years there has been interest in developing a Universal Plug and Play (UPnP) protocol by which a variety of devices could automatically configure themselves with any of a variety of different networks.  This would be particularly helpful for home users who are increasingly setting up small networks so they can share broadband Internet connections, as well as the growing number of users who want their desktop PC to work with handheld (palm) computers and other devices.  Microsoft supports UPnP in versions of Windows starting with ME and XP.",0,233,1280,10,129,0.5536480686695279,0.38626609442060084,4.5665236051502145,23.3,44.75642822966512,12.208846889952156,14.293014354066987,13.506818969022046,11.617224880382775,0.39914163090128757,0.20833333333333334,0.09583333333333334,0.04583333333333333,0.041666666666666664,0.12916666666666668,0.05,14,0.060085836909871244,8,0,0,0,0,0.034334763948497854,1,1

"A chipset is a group of electronic components in a computer or device that manages the data flow between the processor, memory, and other peripherals.  The chipset acts as an intermediary between the various components of the system, controlling the communication and coordinating the exchange of information between them.  The chipset is typically composed of two parts: the northbridge and the southbridge.  The northbridge manages communication between the processor, memory, and high-speed devices, such as graphics card, while the southbridge manages communication with lower-speed peripherals, such as USB and audio devices.  The chipset plays a critical role in the performance and stability of a computer, as it is responsible for controlling many of the system's functions, such as memory and I/O management, interrupt handling, power management, and others.  The chipset also determines the capabilities of the system, such as the supported memory types and speeds, the number of USB ports, and other features.  The design and features of the chipset can have a significant impact on the overall performance and functionality of a computer, and chipset manufacturers continuously improve and update their products to provide better performance and support new technologies.",1,217,1283,7,99,0.45622119815668205,0.3225806451612903,5.009216589861751,31.0,22.785026178010497,16.85980553477936,21.176065818997756,18.243605946275583,15.242931937172774,0.4147465437788018,0.3056768558951965,0.07423580786026202,0.08296943231441048,0.013100436681222707,0.10480349344978165,0.017467248908296942,3,0.013824884792626729,17,0,1,0,0,0.07834101382488479,0,3

Typical example of this is an attack wherea hacker pretends to be a high positioned IT executive traveling on companybusiness and having problems to connect to the organization’s informationsystem through its remote access point. The person may gradually succeed in persuading the Help Desk operatorto tell him or her all the necessary details for the connection set-up.  Later onattacker calls again, complaining that his password for some reason does notwork and persuades the Help Desk to change it to a password of her or hisliking.  Hence, the person may gain unauthorized access ,.

"The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) is a fundamental component of a computer's central processing unit (CPU) that performs arithmetic and logical operations.  The ALU is responsible for performing basic calculations and comparisons, such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and logic operations such as AND, OR, NOT, XOR, and others.  The ALU receives inputs from the CPU's internal register and memory, performs the specified operation, and then stores the result back in the register or memory.  The operation performed by the ALU is determined by the instruction sent to the CPU by the computer's software.  The performance and efficiency of the ALU are critical to the overall performance of the computer, as it is responsible for executing the majority of the operations performed by the CPU.  The design of the ALU, including the number of bits it can operate on and the number of operations it can perform in a single clock cycle, is an important factor in determining the performance of the computer.  In modern computers, the ALU is integrated into the CPU as part of the digital circuit, and its design is constantly being improved to increase performance and efficiency.",1,221,1193,7,95,0.4298642533936652,0.2669683257918552,4.51131221719457,31.571428571428573,24.113821989528816,16.67446522064323,20.966641735228123,18.548980349730343,12.479581151832463,0.4253393665158371,0.22026431718061673,0.07488986784140969,0.07488986784140969,0.013215859030837005,0.11894273127753303,0.048458149779735685,7,0.03167420814479638,16,0,0,0,0,0.07239819004524888,0,2

"Tape drives are a type of data storage technology that use magnetic tape to store and retrieve digital information.  The first tape drives were developed in the early 1950s as a means of storing large amounts of data in a cost-effective and compact manner. The early tape drives were large, cumbersome devices that were primarily used by businesses and government organizations for data backup and archival purposes.  The tapes themselves were made of a thin strip of plastic coated with a magnetic material that could be read and written to by the tape drive's read/write head. Over time, tape drives became smaller and more reliable, with increased storage capacities and faster read/write speeds.  They remained popular in the business and government sectors, where data backup and archival requirements were often high, and the cost per gigabyte of storage was lower than alternative technologies like hard disk drives. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, tape drives faced competition from newer storage technologies like hard disk drives and solid-state drives.  However, tape drives have continued to evolve, with the introduction of technologies like Linear Tape-Open (LTO) and Advanced Intelligent Tape (AIT), which have increased storage capacities and improved performance. Today, tape drives remain a popular choice for businesses and organizations that require large-scale data backup and archival capabilities, particularly in industries like healthcare, finance, and government, where data retention and compliance requirements are strict.",1,261,1553,9,131,0.5019157088122606,0.3524904214559387,5.045977011494253,29.0,36.04790653314262,14.662889842632335,17.737529804482595,16.18397175987059,14.993991416309015,0.3065134099616858,0.3212996389891697,0.08303249097472924,0.10469314079422383,0.018050541516245487,0.10469314079422383,0.04332129963898917,8,0.03065134099616858,14,0,0,0,0,0.05363984674329502,1,4
"A logic bomb is a type of malicious code or software that is intentionally inserted into a computer system to perform a specific action or cause damage at a predetermined time or under specific conditions.  Logic bombs can be programmed to execute when certain conditions are met, such as when a specific date or time is reached, when a certain program is executed, or when a specific user performs a certain action. The purpose of a logic bomb is often to cause damage or disrupt normal system operations, such as by deleting files, corrupting data, or shutting down critical services.  Logic bombs can be difficult to detect and prevent, as they can be designed to lie dormant for long periods of time before executing. Logic bombs are illegal and considered a serious threat to computer security.  They are often used by hackers, disgruntled employees, or other malicious actors to cause damage or gain unauthorized access to computer systems.

"Encryption is the process of conversion of an easily understood format (text)into another format apparently lacking sense because it is encoded.  Theencrypted text is called ciphertext ,. In the Encryption context, Algorithms use a key to control encryption anddecryption (See Algorithm), two categories are used:Symmetric (or Secret-key): Uses the same key for encryption & decryption, orthe latter key is easily derived from the encryption key ,. Asymmetric (or Public key): A different key is used for encrypting and decrypting a message; accordingly, the decrypting key cannot be derived from theencrypting key.  (See also Algorithms, Tables 11A and 11B). A majority of cryptographic products are software rather than hardwarebased.  Moreover, many are communications-oriented rather than data storageoriented; they heavily tend towards secure electronic mail, IP security (IPsec),and Virtual Private Network applications.

"Newsgroups emerged in the early days of the internet as a way for people to communicate and share information with each other.  The development of newsgroups can be traced back to the 1970s, when the first email systems were created.  At that time, email was used primarily by academics and researchers, who used it to share information and collaborate on projects. In the late 1970s, a new communication protocol called Usenet was developed, which allowed people to post and read messages in public discussion forums called newsgroups.  Usenet was decentralized, meaning that anyone with an internet connection could participate in discussions and post messages in newsgroups on a wide range of topics. As the internet grew in popularity in the 1990s, so did the number of people using newsgroups.  At their peak, there were tens of thousands of newsgroups covering a wide range of topics, from politics and religion to sports and entertainment.  Some newsgroups were moderated by volunteers who ensured that discussions remained civil and on-topic, while others were unmoderated and often became heated and contentious. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, the popularity of newsgroups began to wane as other forms of online communication, such as social media and instant messaging, emerged.  However, newsgroups continue to exist today, albeit with much smaller user bases than in their heyday.  Many newsgroups have migrated to web forums or email discussion lists, but the basic idea of public discussion forums where people can share information and ideas lives on.",1,276,1570,11,140,0.5072463768115942,0.3442028985507246,4.7644927536231885,25.09090909090909,40.480777656078885,13.236575392479008,15.962175976633809,14.811377253095038,12.8706827309237,0.38768115942028986,0.2736842105263158,0.12631578947368421,0.07719298245614035,0.021052631578947368,0.12982456140350876,0.03859649122807018,11,0.03985507246376811,16,0,0,0,0,0.057971014492753624,1,0
"Even  after  decades  of  evolution  in  computing,  the  hard disk  drive  remains  the  primary  means  of  fast  data  storage and  retrieval  in  computer  systems  of  all  sizes.   The  disk itself consists of a rigid aluminum alloy platter coated with a  magnetic  oxide  material.   The  platter  can  be  rotated  at speeds of more than 10,000 rpm.  A typical drive consists of a stack of such platters mounted on a rotating spindle, with a read/write head mounted above each platter. Early  hard  drive  heads  were  controlled  by  a  stepper motor, which positioned the head in response to a series of electrical pulses.  (This system is still used for floppy drives. ) Today’s hard drives, however, are controlled by a voice-coil actuator,  similar  in  structure  to  an  audio  speaker.   The  coil surrounds a magnet.  When a current enters the coil, it gen-erates a magnetic field that interacts with that of the perma-nent magnet, moving the coil and thus the disk head.  Unlike the stepper motor, the voice coil is continuously variable and its  greater  precision  allows  data  tracks  to  be  packed  more tightly on the platter surface, increasing disk capacity. The  storage  capacity  of  a  drive  is  determined  by  the number  of  platters  and  the  spacing  (and  thus  number)  of tracks  that  can  be  laid  down  on  each  platter.   Capacities have  steadily  increased  while  prices  have  plummeted:  In 1980,  for  example,  a  hard  drive  for  an  Apple  II  microcom-put  er cost more than $1,000 and held only 5 mB of data.  As of  2007  internal  hard  drives  with  a  capacity  of  500 gB  or more cost around a $150. 00.",0,301,1668,14,157,0.521594684385382,0.3687707641196013,4.2425249169435215,21.5,53.75977154424527,10.844135338345865,13.447773279352226,12.635684438814376,9.703759398496242,0.3853820598006645,0.20185614849187936,0.06496519721577726,0.05104408352668213,0.025522041763341066,0.10208816705336426,0.027842227378190254,8,0.026578073089700997,14,0,1,0,0,0.046511627906976744,3,0

"The Domain Name System (DNS) is a system used to translate human-readable domain names, such as www. example. com, into machine-readable IP addresses, such as 192. 0. 2. 1. DNS is a hierarchical and decentralized naming system that provides a way for computers to locate and connect to other computers and services on the Internet. When a user enters a domain name into a web browser or other network application, the application sends a request to a DNS server to resolve the domain name into an IP address.  The DNS server then checks its own cache or forwards the request to other DNS servers until it finds the IP address associated with the domain name. DNS also provides other important functions, such as domain name registration, delegation, and management, as well as security features like DNSSEC (DNS Security Extensions) that help prevent DNS attacks and ensure the authenticity of DNS information. DNS is a critical component of the Internet infrastructure and is used by billions of people and devices worldwide every day.",1,194,1036,11,99,0.5103092783505154,0.3556701030927835,4.453608247422681,17.636363636363637,40.239186046511634,13.750996677740869,15.875083056478406,14.554592549557764,11.287209302325586,0.3556701030927835,0.295,0.08,0.075,0.03,0.085,0.02,19,0.0979381443298969,8,0,0,0,0,0.041237113402061855,0,0
"To see a simple shell in action, a Windows user need only bring up a command prompt, type the word dir, and press Enter.  A shell called command. com provides the user interface for users of IBM PC-compatible systems running MS-DOS.  The command processor displays a prompt on the screen.  It then interprets , the user’s commands.  If the command involves one of the shell’s internal operations (such as “dir” to list a file directory), it simply executes that routine.  For example the command:dir temp /pwould be interpreted as a call to execute the dir function, passing it the name “temp” (a directory) and the /p, which dir interprets as a “switch” or instruction telling it to pause the directory listing after each screenful of text.  If the command is an external MS-DOS utility such as “xcopy” (a file copying program), the shell runs that program, passing it the information (mainly file names) from the command line.  Finally, the shell can run any other executable program on the system.  It is then that program’s responsibility to interpret and act upon any additional information that was provided. MS-DOS also has the ability for the command. com shell to read a series of commands stored in a text file called a batch file, and having the *. bat (batch) extension.  This allowed for rudimentary scripting of system housekeeping operations or other routine tasks ,.",0,282,1382,14,131,0.4645390070921986,0.2978723404255319,4.049645390070922,20.142857142857142,55.38970524017469,9.597145976294449,11.957704304429196,11.765960540728905,9.921397379912662,0.35815602836879434,0.2668918918918919,0.10135135135135136,0.0472972972972973,0.02364864864864865,0.06756756756756757,0.02364864864864865,4,0.014184397163120567,12,0,1,0,0,0.0425531914893617,0,0

"New media, which refers to digital technologies and platforms such as social media, online video, mobile apps, and other forms of digital content, has brought about many benefits, such as greater access to information, enhanced communication, and new forms of creativity and expression.  However, it has also brought about a number of challenges, including:Information overload: With so much information available at our fingertips, it can be difficult to filter out noise and find reliable sources of information.  The sheer volume of content can also be overwhelming and can lead to feelings of stress and anxiety. Privacy and security: New media platforms collect vast amounts of personal data, which can be vulnerable to hacking and other security breaches.  This has raised concerns about privacy and the protection of personal information. Misinformation and fake news: New media has made it easier for misinformation and fake news to spread quickly and widely.  This has led to increased polarization, decreased trust in traditional news sources, and the erosion of public discourse. Addiction and mental health: New media has been linked to addiction and negative impacts on mental health, such as depression, anxiety, and sleep disturbances.  This is due in part to the constant connectivity and stimulation that new media provides, as well as the pressures to maintain a social media presence and engage with online communities. Economic disruption: New media has disrupted traditional business models in industries such as journalism, entertainment, and retail, leading to job losses and economic uncertainty.  This has also created new opportunities for entrepreneurs and digital creators, but has also widened the gap between winners and losers in the digital economy.

"Fabrication of computer chips in more than 200 large plants around the world involves a variety of toxic chemicals and waste products.  The Silicon Valley alone is home to 29 toxic sites under the EPA’s Superfund Program.  The shift of much of semiconductor and computer component manufacturing to  countries  such  as  China  that  have  less  strict  pollution controls  has  also  exacerbated  what  has  become  a  global problem. Whether through regulation or enlightened self-interest, companies  that  want  to  reduce  future  emissions  can  use several strategies.  manufacturing equipment and processes can be modified so they create fewer toxic substances or at least  keep  them  from  getting  into  the  environment.   Non-toxic  (or  less  toxic)  materials  can  be  substituted  where possible—for  example,  use  of  ozone-depleting  chlorofluo-rocarbons (CFCs) as cleaning agents has been largely elimi-nated.   Finally,  waste  can  be  properly  sorted  and  disposed of, and recycled wherever feasible.

"Ruby is a high-level, dynamic, object-oriented programming language that was created in the mid-1990s by Yukihiro ""Matz"" Matsumoto in Japan.  It was designed to be simple, easy to learn, and productive for developers. Ruby is known for its elegant syntax and its focus on programmer productivity.  It has a strong emphasis on object-oriented programming and provides many features for working with objects, including classes, inheritance, and polymorphism. Ruby is also a versatile language that can be used for a wide variety of programming tasks, including web development, system administration, data analysis, and more.  It has a large and active community of developers who contribute libraries, tools, and frameworks that make it easy to build complex applications. One of the most popular web frameworks built with Ruby is Ruby on Rails, also known simply as Rails.  Rails is a web application framework that provides a set of conventions and tools for building database-backed web applications.

"Biometric identification systems are a type of authentication system that uses unique biological characteristics to verify the identity of an individual.  These systems rely on biometric data, which can include fingerprints, iris scans, facial recognition, voiceprints, and other physiological or behavioral traits. Biometric identification systems typically work by capturing biometric data from an individual and comparing it to a stored database of biometric data to verify the individual's identity.  The system may also perform additional verification steps, such as checking against a list of authorized users or requiring the user to enter a password or PIN. Biometric identification systems offer several advantages over traditional authentication systems, such as:Increased security - Biometric data is unique to each individual and cannot be easily replicated or stolen, making it more difficult for attackers to gain unauthorized access. Convenience - Biometric identification systems are easy to use and can provide fast and accurate authentication, eliminating the need for users to remember passwords or carry physical tokens. Cost-effective - Biometric identification systems can be cost-effective in the long term, as they eliminate the need for expensive physical tokens or manual verification processes. However, biometric identification systems also have some limitations and potential drawbacks.  These can include:Privacy concerns - Biometric data is highly personal and sensitive, and there may be concerns about how it is collected, stored, and used. Accuracy and reliability - Biometric identification systems may not always be accurate or reliable, as factors such as lighting conditions or changes in an individual's appearance can affect the accuracy of the biometric data. Implementation challenges - Biometric identification systems can be complex and costly to implement, requiring specialized hardware and software, and may require significant training and support for users. Overall, biometric identification systems offer a promising approach to authentication and security, but must be implemented carefully and with appropriate safeguards to ensure privacy and accuracy.",1,348,2205,12,164,0.47126436781609193,0.3275862068965517,5.439655172413793,29.0,-4.775701754385949,20.218947368421052,23.291228070175436,19.78447435784618,18.327631578947372,0.33045977011494254,0.2647887323943662,0.10704225352112676,0.14929577464788732,0.02535211267605634,0.061971830985915494,0.0647887323943662,4,0.011494252873563218,19,0,2,0,0,0.05459770114942529,1,4
"Prior to the court-ordered breakup of AT&T in 1984, the phone industry functioned in a monolithic way and was not very responsive to the needs of the growing computer networking industry. The breakup of AT&T led to growing competition, providing a wider variety of telecommunications equipment and lower phone rates just as PC users were starting to buy modems and sign up with online services and bulletin boards.  The growing deregulation movement in the 1990s (culminating in the Telecommunications Act of 1996) furthered this process by opening cable and broadcast television, radio, and other wireless communication to competition. With more than half of American Internet users on high-speed connections ,, the delivery of communications and media over the Net can only grow.  Wireless and mobile services (satellite, cell network, and 802. 11—see wireless computing) have also been growing vigorously.

"There are a variety of ways to electronically register, store, and process votes.  In recent years older manual systems (paper ballots or mechanical voting machines) have been replaced in many areas with systems ranging from purely digital (touch screens) to hybrid systems where marked paper ballots are scanned and tabulated by machine.  However, voting systems have been subject to considerable controversy, particularly following the Florida debacle in the 2000 U. S.  presidential election. The criteria by which voting systems are evaluated include:, how easy it is for the voter to understand and use the system, accessibility for disabled persons, whether the voter’s intentions are accurately recorded , the ability to make a permanent record of the vote, prevention of tampering (physical or electronic), provisions for independent auditing of the votes in case of disputeThe degree to which a given system meets these criteria can vary considerably because of both design and implementation issues.",0,175,1009,4,111,0.6342857142857142,0.49142857142857144,4.88,43.75,5.7439473684210895,21.89842105263158,24.147368421052633,20.503739492662863,15.092105263157897,0.3485714285714286,0.2768361581920904,0.096045197740113,0.0903954802259887,0.03389830508474576,0.1016949152542373,0.05084745762711865,3,0.017142857142857144,10,0,1,0,0,0.05714285714285714,1,0
"Transmitting data involves the sending of bits (ones and zeros) as signaled by some alternation in physical characteristics (such as voltage or frequency).  There are a number of ways in which errors can be introduced into the data stream.  For example, electrical “noise” in the line might be interpreted as spurious bits, or a bit might be “flipped” from one to zero or vice versa.  Generally speaking, the faster the rates at which bits are being sent, the more sensitive the transmission is to effects that can cause errors. While a few wrong characters might be tolerated in some text messages or graphics files, binary files representing executable programs must generally be received perfectly, since random changes can make programs fail or produce incorrect results.

"In computing, the term ""last mile"" refers to the final leg of the telecommunications network that connects the end user to the wider network.  The last mile typically refers to the physical connection between a user's premises (such as a home or office) and the telecommunications provider's network infrastructure. The last mile is often considered the most challenging and expensive part of the telecommunications network to build and maintain, as it involves deploying physical infrastructure (such as cables or wireless towers) to reach individual homes and businesses.  In many cases, the cost of deploying and maintaining this infrastructure can be prohibitively high, particularly in rural or remote areas. The quality and reliability of the last mile connection can have a significant impact on the performance and usability of internet and telecommunications services.  For example, if the last mile connection is slow or unreliable, users may experience slow internet speeds, dropped calls, or other issues that impact their ability to access and use digital services.

"Concern about potential tampering with computers has led many jurisdictions to begin to replace touchscreen systems with optical-scan systems, where the voter marks a sturdy paper ballot.  (About half of U. S.  counties now use optical-scan systems. ) The advantage of optical systems is that the voter physically marks the ballot and can see how he or she has voted, and after tabulation the physical ballots are available for review in case of problems.  However, optical-scan ballots must be properly marked using the correct type of pencil, or they may not be read correctly.  Unlike the touchscreen, it is not possible to give the voter immediate feedback so that any errors can be corrected.  Optical-ballot systems may cost more because of paper and printing costs for the ballots, which may have to be prepared in several languages.  However this cost may be offset by not having to develop or validate the more complicated software needed for all-electronic systems.",0,172,975,7,104,0.6046511627906976,0.436046511627907,4.72093023255814,24.571428571428573,44.658300159235665,11.905788216560513,13.709872611464968,13.427899808715576,11.876433121019112,0.4127906976744186,0.2074468085106383,0.11170212765957446,0.10638297872340426,0.0425531914893617,0.09042553191489362,0.09042553191489362,1,0.005813953488372093,6,0,0,0,0,0.03488372093023256,2,7
"access Control Matrix means preparing a system permitting to bring together user and the system’s available resources.  Preparing a matrix requires the following steps: A broad level of groups of resources that share the same or similar security objectives is established based on requirements for Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability, User Accountability, Authentication and Audit (Compliance) (CIA UAA).  The resources include files, directories, applications, databases, hosts services, processes and others including those protected by the operating system or by other mechanisms.  Users are grouped according to common security needs into functional teams and a group owner is identified who is responsible for group management If necessary, naming standards for resources can be defined based on the findings under 1 & 2 above, thereby further facilitating resource groupings.

"There are several alternative options for user interfaces (UI) that can be used in place of the traditional graphical user interface (GUI).  Some of these options include:Command-line interface (CLI): This is a text-based interface where the user types in commands to interact with the system.

Natural language interface (NLI): This is an interface that allows users to interact with the system using natural language, such as spoken language or written text.  NLI is often used in voice assistants and chatbots. Gesture-based interface: This is an interface that uses gestures, such as swiping or pinching, to control the system.

"The official standard for serial transmission is called RS232C.  It defines various additional pins to which wires are connected, such as for synchronization (specifying when the device is ready to send or receive data) and ground.  Physically, the old-style connectors are called DB-25 because they contain 25 pins (many of which are not used).  Most newer PCs have DB-9 (i. e.  nine pin) connectors.  A “gender changer” can be used in cases where two devices both have male connectors (with pins) or female connectors (with corresponding sockets). Because they use a single data transmission line and include error-correction, serial cables can be longer than parallel cables (25 feet or more, as opposed to 10–12 feet).  Serial transmission is generally slower (at up to 115,200 bits/second) than parallel transmission.

"Industrial robotics refers to the use of robots in industrial manufacturing processes.  The development of industrial robotics can be traced back to the 1950s and 1960s, when the first programmable robots were created. The first industrial robot, the Unimate, was created in 1954 by George Devol and Joseph Engelberger.  It was used to automate the production line at a General Motors plant in New Jersey.  The Unimate was a large, hydraulic robot that could lift heavy objects and move them along a set path.  It was controlled by a computer program that could be programmed to repeat a set of motions. In the following years, the use of industrial robots became more widespread, particularly in the automotive industry.  Robots were used to perform tasks such as welding, painting, and assembly on production lines.  This led to increased efficiency and productivity in manufacturing processes, as well as improved worker safety. As technology advanced, industrial robots became more advanced and capable.  They became smaller and more precise, and were able to perform a wider range of tasks.  Today, industrial robots are used in a variety of industries, including electronics, pharmaceuticals, and food production.  They continue to play an important role in increasing efficiency, productivity, and safety in manufacturing processes.",1,237,1339,13,114,0.4810126582278481,0.3206751054852321,4.742616033755274,18.23076923076923,37.820903010033476,11.939806763285027,15.064882943143813,14.106358169646779,12.994202898550725,0.35443037974683544,0.22764227642276422,0.10975609756097561,0.0975609756097561,0.028455284552845527,0.1016260162601626,0.052845528455284556,12,0.05063291139240506,17,0,0,0,0,0.07172995780590717,0,1

"The benefits of RFID technology are numerous: better inventory control ,; more secure passports and other forms of ID; faster, easier access to transportation systems; and potentially, the avoidance of mishaps in hospitals, such as the wrong patient receiving a drug or procedure. However, there are privacy and security concerns that remain to be fully resolved.  The primary threat is that unauthorized persons could illicitly obtain information or track people or goods, for purposes ranging from simple larceny to identity theft.  Privacy rights organizations have also raised concerns that information about consumer purchases could be used for unwanted marketing (or sold to third parties), while information about a library patron’s reading habits could trigger unwarranted government investigations in the name of fighting terrorism. There is an incentive to produce RFID cards and tags that are resistant to unauthorized reading or tampering.  A cryptographic protocol can be used such that no information will be sent or received unless the reader and tag “know” the correct keys.  Another possibility is to create a device that can “jam” reading attempts in the device’s vicinity, perhaps protecting a customer’s grocery cart from being scanned.  Finally, RFID cards can be put inside in a sleeve of material that blocks the signals.  However, cryptographic and other security technologies raise the cost of RFID devices and may make them impracticable for some applications. In September 2006 the National Science Foundation awarded a $1. 1 million grant to the RFID Consortium for Security and Privacy to study potential risks and safeguards for the technology.  That same year a group of major corporations together with the National Consumers League released a draft set of standards and guidelines for best practices in using RFID, with broader scope than the existing EPC (electronic product code) standard",0,335,1923,12,195,0.582089552238806,0.4507462686567164,4.841791044776119,27.916666666666668,29.16954081632656,15.277244897959182,18.50748299319728,17.219254097808864,14.24081632653061,0.3522388059701492,0.2743362831858407,0.09144542772861357,0.07964601769911504,0.035398230088495575,0.09734513274336283,0.05604719764011799,11,0.03283582089552239,11,3,1,0,0,0.041791044776119404,2,7

"Steganography is the practice of concealing a message or data within another file, image, or message to avoid detection.  The hidden message is usually encrypted before being concealed, and can only be accessed by someone who knows how to extract it.  This technique is often used to covertly transmit sensitive or secret information without being detected.

"The quality of scanned images can be affected by several factors, including:Resolution: The resolution of a scanner determines the level of detail in the scanned image.  Higher resolution scanners produce more detailed images, but also require more time to scan and create larger file sizes. Color Depth: The color depth of a scanner determines the number of colors that can be represented in the scanned image.  Higher color depths produce more realistic and accurate images, but also result in larger file sizes. Dynamic Range: The dynamic range of a scanner determines the range of brightness levels that can be captured in the scanned image.  Higher dynamic ranges allow for more subtle variations in brightness and contrast, resulting in more realistic and accurate images. Scanning Speed: The scanning speed of a scanner can affect the quality of the image, especially if the scanner is moving too quickly or too slowly.  Slow scanning speeds can result in blurring or distortion of the image, while fast scanning speeds can result in reduced image quality. Scanner Quality: The quality of the scanner itself can affect the quality of the scanned image.  High-quality scanners are designed to produce more accurate and consistent images, while lower-quality scanners may produce images with more noise or distortion. Image Processing: The software used to process and edit the scanned image can also affect its quality.  Advanced image processing software can correct for common scanning issues such as color balance, sharpness, and noise reduction. Overall, the quality of scanned images is influenced by a variety of factors, and it's important to choose the right scanner and use the appropriate settings and software to achieve the best results.",1,310,1755,13,117,0.3774193548387097,0.2129032258064516,4.751612903225807,23.846153846153847,40.13549014162737,12.95465703971119,15.310080533185227,14.106358169646779,12.941516245487371,0.3580645161290323,0.26875,0.121875,0.109375,0.04375,0.0875,0.053125,2,0.0064516129032258064,11,0,7,0,0,0.035483870967741936,0,2
"Dell Computer (NASDAQ: DELL) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers and sellers of desktop and laptop computers ,.  By 2008 Dell had more than 88,000 employees worldwide. The company was founded by Michael Dell, a student at the University of Texas at Austin whose first company was PC’s Limited, founded in 1984.  Even at this early stage Dell successfully employed several practices that would come to typify the Dell strategy: Sell directly to customers (not through stores), build each machine to suit the customer’s preferences, and be aggressive in competing on price. In 1988 the growing company changed its name to Dell Computer Corporation.  In the early 1990s Dell tried an alternative business model, selling through warehouse clubs and computer superstores.  When that met with little success, Dell returned to the original formula.

"For people who find commercial online services to be too expensive or confining, there are alternatives available for just the cost of an Internet connection.  The popular Internet Relay Chat (IRC) was developed in Finland by Jarkko Oikarinen in the late 1980s.  Using one of the freely available client programs, users connect to an IRC server, which in turn is connected to one of dozens of IRC networks.  Users can create their own chat rooms (called channels).  There are thousands of IRC channels with participants all over the world.  To participate, a user simply joins a channel and sees all messages currently being posted by other users of the channel.  In turn, the user’s messages are posted for all to see.  While IRC uses only text, there are now enhanced chat systems (often written in Java to work with a Web browser) that add graphics and other features. There are many other technologies that can be used for conversing via the Internet.  Some chat services (such as Cu-SeeMe) enable participants to transmit their images ,.

"Client-server computing is a model of distributed computing where tasks are divided between clients and servers.  In this model, a client is a computer or device that requests data or services from a server, which is a computer or device that provides the data or services requested by the client. The client-server model is widely used in computer networks and the internet to provide a wide range of services, such as email, web browsing, file sharing, and database access.  The model allows multiple clients to access a centralized resource or service, which can be more efficient and cost-effective than having each client perform the same task independently. In a client-server architecture, the client typically sends a request to the server, which processes the request and returns the requested data or service to the client.

"A little later, bulletin boards and especially systems such as the WELL (Whole Earth ’Lectronic Link) based in the San Francisco Bay Area , provided long-term outlets for people to share information and interact on-line. Looking at the WELL, a writer named Howard Rheingold introduced the term virtual community in a 1993 book.  He explored the ways in which a sufficiently compelling and versatile technology encouraged people to form long-term contacts, form personal relationships, and carry out feuds.  When on-line, participants experience such a venue as the WELL as a place that becomes almost as tangible (and often as “real”) as a physical place such as a small town or corner bar. Virtual community members who live in the same geographical area sometimes do get together physically (the WELL has had picniclike “WELL Office Parties” for many years).  Members can band together to support a colleague who faces a crisis such as the life-threatening illness of a son (on the WELL, blank postings called beams are often used as an expression of sympathy).  The virtual community can also serve as a rallying point following a physical disaster such as the 1989 earthquake in the San Francisco Bay Area.

"RTF stands for Rich Text Format.  It is a file format used for storing formatted text and graphics that can be easily exchanged between different word processors and operating systems.  RTF files can be opened and edited by many different software applications, including Microsoft Word, Google Docs, LibreOffice, and others. RTF files contain a mixture of plain text and formatting codes that describe how the text should be displayed.  These codes include instructions for fonts, colors, text styles (such as bold or italic), paragraph formatting, and more.  RTF files may also include images, tables, and other types of multimedia. One of the main advantages of RTF is its compatibility across different platforms and software applications.  Since RTF is a standardized format, it can be opened and edited by many different word processors and text editors, without the need for additional software or converters. However, one potential limitation of RTF is that it may not support all the advanced features or formatting options of a particular word processor or software application.

"The dark side of online advertising is found in programsthat are surreptitiously installed on users’ PCs and thendownload and display advertising from shady Web operations ,.  While many users nowregularly run programs to block such malware, even legitimate online advertising can irritate users, particularlywhen ads are too prominent, float over (and block) text, orlurk behind the browser window.  Modern Web browsershave ad-blocking features that work with varying degreesof effectiveness.  As with TV, online advertisers increasinglyhave to cope with impatient users who do not have to lookat ads unless they actually want to. Advertisers can employ several strategies to keep userswilling to look at ads.  One is to make the ad unobtrusiveand brief, and on the way to something the user reallywants to see.  In 2007 YouTube began such advertising.

"Today, millions of people—middle, high school, and college students, but increasingly adults as well—have pages on popular Web sites such as MySpace and Facebook.  These sites are significant examples of social networking: the use of Web sites and communications and collaboration technology to help people find, form, and maintain social relationships. The origins of social networking can be traced to online venues that arose in the 1970s and 1980s, notably Usenet and, later, online chat boards ,.  In the late 1990s social networking Web sites began to appear, including Classmates. com (helping people find and communicate with former schoolmates) and SixDegrees. com, which emphasized “knows someone who knows someone who .  .  . ” kinds of links.

"Critical Information Infrastructure (CII) refers to the information and communication technology (ICT) systems and networks that are vital to the functioning of a society or an economy. CII includes various types of infrastructure, such as telecommunication networks, financial systems, transportation systems, energy grids, and government databases, that are essential for providing services and enabling economic activity. Because CII is essential for the functioning of society, it is also a potential target for cyber attacks or other forms of disruption.  Protecting CII is therefore critical for ensuring the resilience and continuity of essential services, as well as protecting national security. Many countries have established policies and regulations for protecting CII, including implementing specific security measures, conducting risk assessments, and establishing incident response plans.  In some cases, government agencies may also collaborate with private sector organizations that operate CII to coordinate security efforts and share information about potential threats or vulnerabilities.",1,171,1108,6,99,0.5789473684210527,0.40350877192982454,5.60233918128655,28.5,-5.739960850111856,20.229228187919464,25.50380313199105,21.19438992294339,19.44295302013423,0.2982456140350877,0.30057803468208094,0.09826589595375723,0.09248554913294797,0.028901734104046242,0.09826589595375723,0.04046242774566474,2,0.011695906432748537,12,0,0,0,0,0.07017543859649122,1,3
"the computing field, virtualization involves the creation of a working model or representation of one system within a different system.  This idea has been widely used in the field since the 1960s.  Some applications of virtualization include:, An appropriate model of a system (such as a programming framework—see application programming interface) that hides unneeded details can make it easier for programmers to understand and access its functions ,. , A compiler for a language that compiles all programs to an intermediate representation (such as “bytecode”).  A virtual machine running on each kind of platform can then run the code, taking care of the details required by the host hardware ,. , A virtual machine created in software can be designed to perform all the functions available on a particular hardware platform or operating system, allowing software to be run on a system different from the one for which it was originally written ,.  For example, there are a number of virtualization programs (such as VMWare for PCs) that can create separate areas in memory, each running a different operating system, such as a version of Windows or Linux. ,? Multiple processors or entire computers can be treated as a single entity for processing a program, with software designed to assign threads of execution to physical processors and to coordinate the use of shared data ,. , A physical device such as a disk drive can be made to appear as several separate devices to the operating system (for better organization of data).  Similarly, many servers can run on the same physical machine.

It was also the first computer to use punched tape as a means of input and output. Zuse continued to build and develop computers throughout his career, including the Z1, Z2, and Z4 machines.  He also invented the first high-level programming language, called Plankalkül, although it was not widely used during his lifetime. Zuse's work on computers and programming languages was groundbreaking and laid the foundation for the development of modern computing.

"Advocates of net neutrality argue that all internet traffic should be treated equally, without discrimination or preference given to any particular website or online service.  Specifically, they argue that internet service providers (ISPs) should not be allowed to block, slow down, or otherwise manipulate internet traffic based on the content or source of that traffic. Here are some of the key arguments made by advocates of net neutrality:Protecting free speech: Net neutrality ensures that all voices on the internet have an equal opportunity to be heard.  If ISPs are allowed to block or slow down certain websites or services, this could restrict the ability of some individuals or groups to communicate online. Promoting innovation: Without net neutrality, ISPs could potentially favor their own products or services over those of their competitors.  This could stifle innovation and limit consumer choice. Preventing discrimination: Net neutrality ensures that all internet traffic is treated equally, regardless of the content, source, or destination of that traffic.  This prevents ISPs from engaging in discriminatory practices that could harm certain groups or individuals. Supporting small businesses: Net neutrality ensures that small businesses have an equal opportunity to reach customers online.  Without net neutrality, larger companies could potentially pay ISPs for faster internet access, giving them an unfair advantage over smaller competitors. Overall, advocates of net neutrality argue that this principle is essential for protecting free speech, promoting innovation, preventing discrimination, and supporting a level playing field for all online businesses and individuals.",1,279,1701,11,122,0.43727598566308246,0.2222222222222222,5.204301075268817,25.363636363636363,21.243692022263474,15.829424860853436,19.684601113172544,17.228024813938504,16.463673469387754,0.31899641577060933,0.2640845070422535,0.14084507042253522,0.09507042253521127,0.03873239436619718,0.0880281690140845,0.04929577464788732,0,0.0,15,0,5,0,0,0.053763440860215055,0,5

Authentication results in positively verifying the identity of a user‚ device‚ or another entity in an information system.  This is often a prerequisite for allowing access to resources offered by a system.  One element that contributes to the reliability of individual authentication is good password management practices.  In an area of high risk‚ stronger authentication may be required such as: Asymmetric Keys—see Access Control Biometrics—see Biometrics Cryptographic Tokens—see Cryptography Digital Certificates—see Digital Certificate Smart Cards—see Smart Card One-Time Password Generators—where password can be used once only.  Stronger authentication relies on combining one or more of the following: password / Pin or something else user knows‚ token or other means‚ that is something user has‚ and finally‚ biometrics or other technique enabling system to identify who the person is.  The above means may be used to verify the true source of a message or data.  But all approaches have their weak spots and combinations of measures are usually more effective.

Parallel Processing occurs when a computer uses more than one processor‚either to be able to perform more than one task at the same time or to improveprocessing speed by breaking down one larger task between different processors.

It just seemsthat way to the user because the two things are handled one after the otherso very quickly.,0,82,467,3,59,0.7195121951219512,0.5365853658536586,4.7560975609756095,27.333333333333332,40.863771929824566,13.853157894736842,16.44912280701754,15.021129683784007,12.107894736842109,0.4634146341463415,0.1724137931034483,0.06896551724137931,0.14942528735632185,0.05747126436781609,0.12643678160919541,0.05747126436781609,7,0.08536585365853659,0,0,0,0,0,0.0,0,4

"Healthy eating habits are especially important for teenagers, as their bodies and minds are still growing and developing. A balanced diet that includes plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats provides the essential nutrients needed for energy, focus, and overall health. Teens should aim to eat regular meals and snacks to maintain stable blood sugar levels and avoid skipping meals, which can lead to overeating later. Staying hydrated with water instead of sugary drinks is also key.

"Web services can be accessed using a variety of protocols and programming languages.  The most common way to access web services is through HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol), using a variety of HTTP methods such as GET, POST, PUT, and DELETE. To access a web service, you typically need to know its API (Application Programming Interface), which is a set of rules that defines how clients can interact with the service.  The API typically includes information about the URL structure, available HTTP methods, input and output formats, and any authentication or authorization requirements. Here are a few common ways to access web services:Using a web browser: Some web services provide a web interface that you can access using a web browser like Chrome, Firefox, or Safari.  This allows you to interact with the service using a graphical user interface (GUI) rather than writing code. Using a programming language: Many programming languages provide libraries or frameworks for accessing web services, such as Python's requests library or Java's Spring framework.  These libraries typically abstract away the details of HTTP communication, allowing you to focus on writing code to interact with the service. Using a tool like Postman: Postman is a popular tool for testing and interacting with web services.  It allows you to send HTTP requests to a web service, inspect the responses, and save the requests for later use. Using command-line tools: Tools like curl or wget can be used to send HTTP requests from the command line.  These tools are often used in scripts or automation workflows. Overall, accessing web services requires an understanding of the service's API and the tools and libraries available in your programming language or environment.  Once you know how to access a web service, you can use it to retrieve data, perform operations, or integrate it into your own applications.",1,352,1898,14,150,0.42613636363636365,0.2556818181818182,4.511363636363637,25.142857142857142,42.58907894736845,12.713439849624063,16.185714285714287,14.756829357015494,12.21842105263158,0.3380681818181818,0.27977839335180055,0.11634349030470914,0.0332409972299169,0.027700831024930747,0.07756232686980609,0.0332409972299169,15,0.04261363636363636,19,0,5,0,0,0.05397727272727273,0,2

"Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) is a method of access control used to restrict access to computer resources based on a user's role or position within an organization.  With RBAC, access is granted based on predefined roles that are associated with certain privileges and permissions. RBAC allows administrators to manage access control at a higher level of abstraction, simplifying the process of granting and revoking access.  In an RBAC system, users are assigned roles based on their job function, and these roles are associated with specific permissions and access levels. For example, a hospital might use RBAC to control access to patient records.  Doctors and nurses would be assigned roles that allow them to access patient records relevant to their job function, while administrative staff would have a different set of roles and access privileges. RBAC provides several benefits, including increased security, simplified administration, and better compliance with regulatory requirements.

"Active OS Fingerprinting is conducted in order to detect the target’s Oper ating System.  It is usually done by sending specially crafted network packets and comparing them against known responses.  Each operating system re sponds to different packet differently and even response to the ping command can give a good indication of the target OS.  Several methods have been developed and fingerprints are widely available on the internet.  The tool of the trade for this is a tool called Network Mapper (nmap).

"Plug and Play (PnP) is a technology standard that allows devices to be automatically configured and connected to a computer without requiring manual intervention from the user.  When a PnP device is connected to a computer, the operating system detects the device and automatically installs the necessary drivers and software to enable the device to function properly. The PnP standard was first introduced in the early 1990s as part of Microsoft's Windows operating system.  It has since been adopted by other operating systems, including macOS and Linux. Some of the key benefits of PnP include:Ease of use: PnP simplifies the process of connecting and configuring new devices, making it easier for users to install and use hardware peripherals. Time-saving: PnP eliminates the need for manual configuration and installation of device drivers, saving time and reducing the risk of errors. Compatibility: PnP ensures that devices are compatible with the operating system and other hardware components, reducing the risk of conflicts and compatibility issues. Scalability: PnP supports the automatic detection and configuration of multiple devices, making it easy to add and remove devices as needed. Overall, PnP has played an important role in making computers more user-friendly and accessible, and has helped to simplify the process of installing and using new hardware devices.",1,237,1382,9,122,0.5147679324894515,0.3628691983122363,4.936708860759493,26.333333333333332,21.85784623486046,16.034849921011055,19.99389152185361,17.5058628484301,14.356398104265402,0.3459915611814346,0.25925925925925924,0.1522633744855967,0.07407407407407407,0.024691358024691357,0.0823045267489712,0.037037037037037035,8,0.03375527426160337,8,0,5,0,0,0.03375527426160337,0,1

"Rich Text Format was developed in the later 1980s by programmers at Microsoft.  Its purpose is to allow for interchange of documents between Microsoft Word and other software, while preserving the original formatting. An RTF file is itself a plain text file containing the document text enclosed in control codes that determine the formatting. Although RTF is an 8-bit format, special escape sequences can be used to specify 16-bit Unicode characters, such as for non-Roman alphabets. Libraries and utilities are available for reading and writing RTF from most popular programming languages, including Perl, PHP, and Ruby. In practice, RTF created by word processors tends to contain many control codes needed to ensure compatibility with older programs, making the files bulky and not practicable to edit directly.

"BASIC was invented at Dartmouth College in 1963–1964 by John G.  Kemeny and Thomas E.  Kurtz, both professors of mathematics, assisted by a group of undergraduate student programmers.  Computers then were huge, slow, and expensive; there were no personal computers.  Their goal was to bring easy and accessible computing to all students, not just science or engineering students.  The method they chose called for developing a time-shared operating system, which would allow many users simultaneously.  (This operating system was developed entirely by Dartmouth undergraduate students. ) The new language, BASIC, easy to learn and easy to use, was an essential part of this effort.  BASIC was thus developed originally for a large multipleuser, time-shared system and not for personal computers, which did not appear widely until the early 1980s.  It has been asked whyBASICwas invented.  Couldn’t an existing language have been used for the purpose? The answer to the second question is no, which also answers the first question.  Other computer languages did exist in 1963, although there were not nearly as many as there are today.  The principal ones were FORTRAN and Algol; most of the others are long since forgotten.  Some of the common languages used today—C, C++, and Java—had not even been conceived.  FORTRAN and Algol were each considered briefly.  These languages were designed for production use on big machines or for scientific research, using punched cards.  But neither was suitable for use by beginners, neither was particularly well suited for a time-shared environment, and neither permitted speedy handling of short programs.  Kemeny and Kurtz had experimented with other simple computer languages as early as 1956, but with only modest success.  So, in 1963, when they began building a time-shared system for students, they quickly realized that a new language had to be invented—BASIC.",0,342,1909,18,181,0.5292397660818714,0.3654970760233918,4.666666666666667,19.0,48.90759459459463,10.114432432432434,12.406486486486488,12.07096230602999,12.356081081081086,0.3830409356725146,0.16129032258064516,0.10215053763440861,0.09408602150537634,0.051075268817204304,0.08064516129032258,0.06989247311827956,24,0.07017543859649122,22,2,0,0,1,0.07309941520467836,1,15

For example, telerobotic surgery allows a surgeon to operate on a patient in a different location using a robot, while telerobotic manufacturing allows a worker to control machinery from a remote location. The use of telerobotics has several advantages, including increased safety, reduced costs, and the ability to operate in hazardous or inaccessible environments.

"The base 16 or hexadecimal system is a natural way to rep-resent the binary data stored in a computer.  It is more com-pact than binary because four binary digits can be replaced by a single “hex” digit. The  following  table  gives  the  corresponding  decimal, binary, and hex values from 0 to 15:Note that decimal and hex digits are the same from 0 to 9,  but  hex  uses  the  letters  A–F  to  represent  the  digits  cor-responding to decimal 10–15.  The system extends to higher numbers  using  increasing  powers  of  16,  just  as  decimal uses  powers  of  10:  For  example,  hex  FF  represents  binary 111  11111 or decimal 255.  many of the apparently arbitrary numbers encountered in programming can be better under-stood  if  one  realizes  that  they  correspond  to  convenient groupings of bits: FF is eight bits, sufficient to hold a single character ,.

"Between 2000 and 2004 the numbers of text messages sent worldwide soared from 17 billion to 500 billion.  At about a dime a message, texting became a major source of revenue for phone companies.  Since then, texting has continued to grow, particularly in parts of Europe, the Asia-Pacific region (particularly China), and Japan (where it has largely become an Internet-based service). In the United States texting is most popular among teenagers ,.  It is not uncommon to see a bench full of teens talking excitedly to one another while carrying on simultaneous texting with unseen friends in what, to many adult onlookers, appears to be an incomprehensible code, their conversation perhaps ending with ttyl (talk to you later).

"Besides military training, currently the most viable application for VR seems to be entertainment.  VR techniques have been used to create immersive experiences in elaborate facilities at venues such as Disneyland and Universal Studios, and to some extent even in local arcades.  VR that is accompanied by convincing physical sensations has allowed for the creation of a new generation of roller coasters that if built physically would be too expensive, too dangerous, or even physically impossible. However, there are other significant emerging applications for VR.  When combined with telerobotic technology ,, VR techniques are already being used to allow surgeons to perform operations in new ways.  VR technology can also be used to make remote conferencing more realistic and satisfactory for participants.  Clearly the potential uses for VR for education and training in many different fields are endless.  VR technology combined with robotics could also be used to give disabled persons much greater ability to carry out the tasks of daily life. In the ultimate VR system, users will be networked and able to simultaneously experience the environment, interacting both with it and one another.

"Hacking refers to the act of accessing computer systems or networks without authorization, and the term ""hacker"" originally referred to someone who was skilled in computer programming and used their skills to solve problems in creative and innovative ways. The first known instance of hacking occurred in 1960, when a group of students at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) explored the limitations of the institution's computer system.  In the following decades, hacking grew in popularity and became associated with both positive and negative activities. In the 1980s, hackers gained notoriety for their involvement in high-profile computer security breaches, such as the Morris Worm, which affected thousands of computers.  This led to the passage of the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act in the United States in 1986, which made computer hacking a federal crime. Since then, the field of cybersecurity has evolved to protect against hacking and other types of cyberattacks.  However, hacking and hackers continue to pose a threat to computer systems and networks, and both ethical and unethical hacking are still practiced today",1,196,1140,7,117,0.5969387755102041,0.5102040816326531,4.923469387755102,28.0,30.63028571428572,15.197714285714287,18.228571428571428,16.613394197324528,14.203428571428574,0.37244897959183676,0.22885572139303484,0.12437810945273632,0.06467661691542288,0.01990049751243781,0.13930348258706468,0.01990049751243781,12,0.061224489795918366,10,0,0,0,0,0.05102040816326531,1,5

"Integers are typically stored in memory as binary digits, or ""bits,"" which are either a 0 or a 1.  The size of the integer (i. e. , the number of bits used to represent it) can vary depending on the programming language and the computer architecture being used. In most modern computers, integers are typically stored using a fixed number of bits, such as 8 bits, 16 bits, 32 bits, or 64 bits.  The number of bits used to represent an integer determines its range of possible values.  For example, an 8-bit integer can represent values between 0 and 255, while a 32-bit integer can represent values between -2,147,483,648 and 2,147,483,647. When an integer is stored in memory, it is typically stored as a binary representation of the integer's value using a fixed number of bits.  The most significant bit (MSB) represents the sign of the integer (positive or negative), while the remaining bits represent the magnitude of the integer. For example, consider the 8-bit integer -23.  In binary, this value is represented as 11101001.  The leftmost bit (1) represents the sign (negative), while the remaining 7 bits (1101001) represent the magnitude of the integer (23).  When this value is stored in memory, the computer will reserve 8 bits of memory and store the binary value 11101001 at the corresponding memory address.",1,261,1322,11,99,0.3793103448275862,0.19540229885057472,4.199233716475096,23.727272727272727,50.71493401206638,10.760825791855204,16.959426847662144,15.247664890283005,9.808144796380091,0.3563218390804598,0.22661870503597123,0.1079136690647482,0.04316546762589928,0.014388489208633094,0.09352517985611511,0.04316546762589928,23,0.08812260536398467,22,0,0,0,0,0.0842911877394636,0,0
"The power of geographic information systems comes from the ability to integrate data from a variety of sources, whether aerial  photography,  census  records,  or  even  scanned  paper maps.  Once in digital form, the data can be represented in a variety of ways for various purposes.  A sophisticated gis can be  queried  to  determine,  for  example,  how  much  of  a  pro-posed  development  would  have  a  downhill  gradient  and  be below sea level such that flooding might be a problem.  These results can in turn be used by simulation programs to deter-mine,  for  example,  whether  release  of  a  chemical  into  the groundwater from a proposed plant site might affect a partic-ula r  town  two  miles  away.  geographic  information  systems are  thus  vital  for  the  management  of  a  variety  of  complex systems  that  are  distributed  over  a  geographical  area,  such as water and sewage systems, power transmission grids, and traffic control systems.

"Originally standing for Simple Object Access Protocol, but now no longer an acronym, SOAP is a standard way to access Web services ,.  In today’s Web, where what appears to users to be a single site or application is usually built from many services, such a facility is essential. Prior to SOAP, Web applications usually communicated through remote procedure calls (RPC).  However there were problems with compatibility of applications running under different operating systems (and perhaps using different programming languages), as well as security problems that often led to such facilities being blocked.

"JavaScript  is  one  of  several  popular  languages  that  can enable  Web  pages  to  interact  with  users  more  quickly  and efficiently ,.  The  language  first  appeared  in  the  mid-1990s’  Netscape  2 browser under the name LiveScript.  Technically, JavaScript is  the  Sun microsystems  trademark  for  its  implementation of  a  standard  called  ECmAScript.   Despite  the  name,  Java-Script  is  not  directly  related  to  the  Java  programming  lan-guage. In  its  early  years  JavaScript  was  perhaps  a  victim  of  its own  success.   Having  a  relatively  easy-to-use  scripting  lan-guage  provided  an  easier  way  to  add  features  such  as  3D buttons  and  pop-up  windows  to  formerly  humdrum  Web forms.   However,  as  with  an  earlier  generation’s  fondness for multiple fonts, early JavaScript programmers were often prone  to  add  unnecessary  and  confusing  clutter  to  Web pages.   Besides  sometimes  annoying  users,  early  JavaScript also  suffered  from  significant  differences  in  how  it  was implemented  by  the  major  browsers.   As  a  result,  Netscape users  were  sometimes  stymied  by  JavaScript  written  for micr  osoft Internet Explorer, and vice versa.  Finally, browser flaws have sometimes allowed JavaScript to be used to com-promise  security  such  as  by  installing  malware-infested “browser helpers. ” As a result, many security experts began to  recommend  that  users  disable  JavaScript  execution  in their browsers.",0,227,1502,11,137,0.6035242290748899,0.45374449339207046,5.07488986784141,20.636363636363637,31.715047489823633,13.375169606512895,16.065309814563545,14.811377253095038,14.840796019900498,0.32599118942731276,0.14545454545454545,0.05714285714285714,0.046753246753246755,0.04935064935064935,0.06753246753246753,0.03116883116883117,18,0.07929515418502203,10,0,0,0,0,0.04405286343612335,1,3

"Introduced in 2002, C# (pronounced “C sharp”) is a programming language similar to C++ and Java but simplified in several respects and tailored for use with Microsoft’s latest programming platform ,.  C# is a general-purpose language and is thoroughly objectoriented—all functions must be declared as members of a class or “struct,” and even fundamental data types are derived from the System. Object class ,. Compared with C++, C# is stricter about the use and conversion of data types, not allowing most implicit conversions (such as from an enumeration type to the corresponding integer—see data structures).  Unlike C++, C# does not permit multiple inheritance (where a type can be derived from two or more base types), thereby avoiding an added layer of complexity in class relationships in large software projects.  (However, a similar effect can be obtained by declaring multiple “interfaces” or specified ways of accessing the same class. )Unlike Java (but like C++), C# includes pointers (and a safer version called “delegates”), enumerations (enum types), structs (treated as lightweight classes), and overloading (multiple definitions for operators).

"The header of a TCP/IP packet contains information that is used to ensure that data is transmitted reliably and efficiently between network devices.  Here are the main fields that are included in the header of a TCP/IP packet:Source port - This field identifies the port number on the sender's device that is being used to transmit the data. Destination port - This field identifies the port number on the recipient's device that the data is being sent to. Sequence number - This field contains a unique sequence number that is assigned to each segment of data that is transmitted.  The sequence number is used to ensure that data is transmitted in the correct order and to detect any missing or duplicate packets. Acknowledgment number - This field is used to acknowledge receipt of the data.  The acknowledgment number contains the next expected sequence number that the recipient is waiting to receive. Data offset - This field specifies the length of the TCP header in 32-bit words.  This field is important because the length of the header can vary depending on the options that are included. Control flags - These are a set of 6 bits that are used to control the flow of data between sender and recipient.  The most important control flags are the SYN (synchronize), ACK (acknowledge), FIN (finish), and RST (reset) flags. Window size - This field specifies the amount of data that the recipient is willing to receive before sending an acknowledgment. Checksum - This field contains a checksum value that is calculated over the entire TCP segment, including the header and data.  The checksum is used to detect any errors that may have occurred during transmission. Urgent pointer - This field is used to indicate that the data in the TCP segment is urgent and should be processed immediately.

"Short for “coder/decoder,” a codec is essentially an algorithm for encoding (and compressing) a stream of data for transmission, and then decoding and decompressing it at the receiving end.  Usually the data involved represents audio or video content ,.  Typically the data is being downloaded from a Web site to be played on a personal computer or portable player ,. A codec is described as “lossy” if some of the original information is lost in the compression process.  It then becomes a question of whether the loss in quality is perceived by the user as significant.  A codec that preserves all the information needed to re-create the original file is “lossless. ” For most purposes, the much greater size of the lossless version of a file is not worth the (often imperceptible) increase in quality or fidelity. A codec is usually used in connection with a “container format” that specifies how the encoded data is to be stored in a file.  Often a container can hold more than one data stream and even more than one kind of media (such as video and audio).  When one refers to a Windows WAV file, for example, one is actually referring to a container.",0,229,1156,10,115,0.5021834061135371,0.34497816593886466,4.148471615720524,22.9,47.44709090909092,11.56028282828283,16.404848484848486,14.836745963215662,9.56666666666667,0.42358078602620086,0.2175732217573222,0.100418410041841,0.06694560669456066,0.0502092050209205,0.11297071129707113,0.058577405857740586,4,0.017467248908296942,7,0,0,0,0,0.03056768558951965,0,2
"Wireless LAN, or WLAN, is a type of wireless network that uses radio waves to provide wireless high-speed internet and network connections between devices within a limited area such as a home, office, or campus. The working of wireless LAN involves the following steps:Wireless Access Point (WAP) - A WAP is a device that connects wireless devices to a wired network using radio signals.  It serves as a central hub for wireless communication between devices within the network. Wireless Network Interface Cards (NICs) - Wireless NICs are installed in devices such as laptops, smartphones, and tablets to allow them to connect to the wireless network. Radio Waves - Radio waves are used to transmit data between the WAP and the wireless NICs.  The WAP broadcasts radio signals, which are received by the wireless NICs within its range. Network Protocols - WLANs use various network protocols such as the 802. 11 standards to ensure that data is transmitted securely and efficiently between devices. Authentication and Encryption - WLANs use authentication and encryption techniques to protect the network from unauthorized access and data theft.  These techniques include WPA and WPA2 encryption, MAC filtering, and SSID hiding. Range Extenders - In case the range of the WAP is limited, range extenders can be used to increase the range of the wireless network.  Range extenders work by amplifying the radio signals and rebroadcasting them to increase the coverage area. Overall, wireless LANs provide users with the convenience and flexibility of wireless communication while maintaining the security and reliability of wired networks.",1,287,1637,13,121,0.42160278745644597,0.2578397212543554,4.7979094076655056,22.076923076923077,40.283110634385565,12.437211155378488,14.097578915108796,13.991409890343128,13.654183266932268,0.3205574912891986,0.2525597269624573,0.10238907849829351,0.07849829351535836,0.010238907849829351,0.08873720136518772,0.030716723549488054,18,0.0627177700348432,11,0,1,0,0,0.03832752613240418,0,0

"Ruby on Rails, also known as simply Rails, is a web application framework written in the Ruby programming language.  It was created by David Heinemeier Hansson in 2004 and has since become one of the most popular web frameworks for building dynamic, database-driven web applications. Rails provides a set of conventions and tools for building web applications, including support for database migrations, model-view-controller (MVC) architecture, and a wide range of plugins and gems that extend its functionality. One of the key features of Rails is its emphasis on convention over configuration.  This means that Rails provides sensible defaults and conventions that help developers get up and running quickly without having to spend a lot of time configuring the framework.  For example, Rails provides a default directory structure for organizing files, a default database schema for storing data, and a set of naming conventions that make it easy to map between database tables and Ruby classes. Rails is also known for its focus on developer productivity, with a philosophy that emphasizes simplicity, elegance, and developer happiness.  This has made it a popular choice for startups and small businesses, as well as larger enterprises. Rails is used by many popular websites and companies, including GitHub, Shopify, Airbnb, and Basecamp.",1,235,1345,9,126,0.5361702127659574,0.3872340425531915,4.829787234042553,26.11111111111111,37.17695652173916,13.787729468599036,16.929468599033818,15.322241378113624,13.846376811594197,0.33191489361702126,0.2979591836734694,0.11428571428571428,0.044897959183673466,0.0326530612244898,0.11836734693877551,0.02857142857142857,10,0.0425531914893617,17,0,0,0,0,0.07234042553191489,0,2
"IBM did succeed in creating RPG (Report Program Generator), a language designed to make it easier for programmers (including beginners) to generate business reports. Most COBOL programs read data, perform tests and calculations, and print the results.  RPG, first released in 1964 for use with the new System/360 mainframe and the smaller System/3, simplifies this process and eliminates most writing of program code statements. A “classic” RPG program is built around the “RPGcycle,” consisting of three stages.  During the input stage, the input device(s), file type, access specifications, and data record structure are specified.  (These specifications can be quite elaborate. ) The heart of the program specifies calculations to be performed with the various data fields, while the output section specifies how the results will be laid out in report form, including such things as headers, footers, and sections. Subsequent versions of RPG added more features.  RPGIV, released in 1994, includes the ability to define subroutines, for example.  IBM has also released VisualAge RPG, which allows for the creation and running of RPG programs in the Microsoft Windows environment.  There are also tools for interfacing RPG programs with various database systems and to use RPG for writing Web-based (CGI) programs",0,242,1315,11,133,0.5495867768595041,0.4090909090909091,4.586776859504132,22.0,45.20539058931024,11.448369118318865,13.869529465509366,13.023866798666859,13.60402010050251,0.30165289256198347,0.2540322580645161,0.12096774193548387,0.04838709677419355,0.016129032258064516,0.08870967741935484,0.036290322580645164,16,0.06611570247933884,18,0,0,0,0,0.0743801652892562,0,0

"A disk cache uses the same general principle as a processor cache.  Here, however, it is RAM (either a part of main memory or separate memory on the disk drive) that is the faster medium and the disk drive itself that is slower.  When an application starts to request data from the disk, the cache reads one or more complete blocks or sectors of data from the disk rather than just the data record being requested.  Then, if the application continues to request sequential data records, these can be read from the high-speed memory on the cache rather than from the disk drive.  It follows that disk caching is most effective when an application, for example, loads a database file that is stored sequentially on the disk",0,140,721,5,75,0.5357142857142857,0.37142857142857144,4.2214285714285715,28.0,54.487070866141735,11.969543307086614,15.199370078740158,14.265292616868656,9.38582677165354,0.45,0.2602739726027397,0.0821917808219178,0.0684931506849315,0.06164383561643835,0.08904109589041095,0.0547945205479452,2,0.014285714285714285,7,0,0,0,0,0.05,1,0

"Java  has  largely  fulfilled  this  promise  for  Web  developers.  C++  programmers  have  an  easy  learning  curve  to  Java, since  the  two  languages  have  very  similar  syntax  and  a similar use of classes and other object-oriented features.  On the  other  hand,  programmers  who  don’t  know  C++  benefit from  Java  being  more  streamlined  than  C++.   For  example, Java avoids the necessity to use pointers ,  and  uses  classes  as  the  consistent  building block of program structure.  Software powerhouses such as microsoft (until recently) and IBm have joined Sun in pro-moting Java. Another  much-touted  feature  of  Java  is  its  platform independence.  The language itself is separate from the vari-ous  operating  system  platforms.   For  each  platform,  a  Java Vir tual machine ( JVm) is created, which interprets or com-piles the code generated by the Java compiler so it can run on that platform. For  security,  Java  applets  run  within  a  “sandbox”  or restricted  environment  so  the  user  is  protected  from  mali-cious   Java   programs.

"Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is a system of hardware, software, and policies used to manage digital certificates and public-private key pairs used in cryptographic systems. PKI uses asymmetric encryption algorithms to generate public and private keys for use in secure communication.  The public key can be freely shared with anyone, while the private key is kept secret by the key owner.  A digital certificate is used to bind a public key to the identity of the key owner, such as a website or an individual. PKI systems provide a secure method for verifying the identity of users and devices, ensuring the integrity of data in transit, and enabling secure communication between parties.  They are used in a variety of applications, including secure web browsing (via HTTPS), email encryption, and secure online transactions.

Ubiquitous Computing is a term put forward by Mark Weiser in Ubiquitous Computing is a term put forward by Mark Weiser in 1988‚ describing it as information technology’s next wave after the mainframe and PC.  In this new world‚ what Weiser called “calm technology” will reside around us‚ interacting with users in natural ways to anticipate their needs and supply the information they want wherever they are.  Pervasive Computing requires that computing devices are ubiquitious and if not invisible‚ at least handy for users and easy to take wherever one wishes to go (e. g. ‚ small cellular used for tracking location of person).  PervasiveComputing envisions environments richly lathered with computation‚ communication and networked devices‚ mobile users interacting with their environment using speech and vision‚ with secure access to personal or publicdata.  Pervasive Computing environments will not simply be standalone vehicles for number crunching‚ rather they will immerse their users in a triad of nvisible computation‚ communication and devices‚ working in concert to satisfy userrequirements according to the facilities available in the environment. As such Pervasive Computing is a world saturated with computing andcommunication on the road to Ubiquitous Computing.

"Disk cache is a technology used to improve the performance of a computer's hard drive by temporarily storing frequently accessed data in a fast memory buffer. When a computer accesses data from a hard drive, it takes time to read the data from the physical disk.  Disk cache works by keeping a copy of frequently accessed data in a faster memory buffer, such as RAM, so that it can be accessed more quickly.  This can significantly improve the speed of data retrieval and overall system performance. Disk cache operates in two main ways:Read cache: This involves storing frequently accessed data from the hard drive in the cache memory.  When the computer needs to read the same data again, it can be retrieved quickly from the cache instead of being read from the hard drive again. Write cache: This involves temporarily storing data that is being written to the hard drive in the cache memory.  This allows the computer to continue working while the data is being written to the slower hard drive, improving overall system performance. However, while disk cache can improve performance, there is a risk of data loss if the cache is not properly managed.  If power is lost or the system crashes before the data is written back to the hard drive, the cached data can be lost.  Therefore, disk cache systems typically incorporate safeguards to ensure that cached data is properly saved before being purged from the cache memory.",1,268,1427,11,98,0.3656716417910448,0.19776119402985073,4.399253731343284,24.363636363636363,53.85717171717175,11.23533108866442,14.103853348297793,13.023866798666859,10.427983539094651,0.3880597014925373,0.24087591240875914,0.15328467153284672,0.058394160583941604,0.06569343065693431,0.08394160583941605,0.06934306569343066,2,0.007462686567164179,9,0,3,0,0,0.033582089552238806,2,3
"The philosophical and spiritual aspects of computing are complex and multifaceted, and they have been the subject of much debate and exploration in recent years.  Here are some key concepts that are relevant to this topic:Ethics of Artificial Intelligence: As artificial intelligence becomes more advanced, questions about the ethics of its development and use have arisen.  For example, some have raised concerns about the potential for AI to reinforce existing biases or to be used for harmful purposes. The Nature of Consciousness: Some philosophers have explored the question of whether computers can truly be conscious.  This raises questions about the nature of consciousness itself and whether it is a product of physical processes or something more elusive. The Impact of Technology on Society: Computing and technology more broadly have had a profound impact on society, changing the way we communicate, work, and interact with each other.  This has raised questions about whether these changes are ultimately positive or negative. The Intersection of Technology and Spirituality: Some have explored the potential for technology to aid in spiritual practices or to facilitate deeper connections with the divine.  Others have raised concerns about the potential for technology to distract us from spiritual practices or to create a sense of disconnection from nature.

"The essential core of the UNIX system is the kernel, which provides facilities to organize and access files ,, move data to and from devices, and control the running of programs (processes).  In designing UNIX, Thompson deliberately kept the kernel small, noting that he wanted maximum flexibility for users.  Since the kernel was the only part of the system that could not be reconfigured or replaced by the user, he limited it to those functions that reliability and efficiency dictated be handled at the system level. Another way in which the UNIX kernel was kept simple was through device independence.  This meant that instead of including specific instructions for operating particular models of terminal, printers, or plotters within the kernel, generic facilities were provided.  These could then be interfaced with device drivers and configuration files to control the particular devices. A UNIX system typically has many users, each of whom may be running a number of programs.  The interface that processes user commands is called the shell.  It is important to note that in UNIX a shell is just another program, so there can be (and are) many different shells reflecting varying tastes and purposes ,.

"In personal computers a chipset is a group of integrated circuits that together perform a particular function.  System purchasers generally think in terms of the processor itself (such as a Pentium III, Pentium IV, or competitive chips from AMD or Cyrix).  However they are really buying a system chipset that includes the microprocessor itself , and often a memory cache (which may be part of the microprocessor or a separate chip—see cache) as well as the chips that control the memory bus (which connects the processor to the main memory on the motherboard—see bus. ) The overall performance of the system depends not just on the processor’s architecture (including data width, instruction set, and use of instruction pipelines) but also on the type and size of the cache memory, the memory bus (RDRAM or “Rambus” and SDRAM) and the speed with which the processor can move data to and from memory. In addition to the system chipset, other chipsets on the motherboard are used to support functions such as graphics (the AGP, or Advanced Graphics Port, for example), drive connection (EIDE controller), communication with external devices ,, and connections to expansion cards (the PCI bus).",0,230,1192,5,115,0.5,0.36086956521739133,4.3304347826086955,46.0,29.50275000000002,18.683916666666665,23.276666666666667,19.48791578843652,12.338541666666668,0.3782608695652174,0.2765957446808511,0.059574468085106386,0.04680851063829787,0.03829787234042553,0.10638297872340426,0.02553191489361702,6,0.02608695652173913,13,0,0,0,0,0.05652173913043478,1,2
"There  are  a  number  of  ways  to  make  a  system  more  fault tolerant.  Individual components such as hard drives can be composed of multiple units so that the remaining units can take over if one fails ,.  If each key component has at least one backup, then there should be time to replace the primary before the backup also fails. Another way to achieve fault tolerance is to provide mul-tiple paths to successful completion of the task.  In fact, this is  how  packet-switched  networks  like  the  Internet  work ,.   If  one  communications  link  is  down  or  too congested, packets are given an alternative routing. Fault diagnosis software can also play an important role both in determining how to respond to a problem (beyond any automatic response) and for providing data that will be useful  later  to  system  administrators  or  technicians.

"RPG, or Report Program Generator, is a high-level programming language originally developed by IBM in the late 1950s for use on their IBM System/3x mid-range computers.  RPG was designed specifically for generating reports and was particularly well-suited for working with the IBM database management system (DB2). Over the years, RPG has evolved and expanded to become a more versatile language, capable of handling more complex programming tasks beyond report generation.  Modern versions of RPG support structured programming constructs, object-oriented programming, and integration with web services. RPG is still widely used today, particularly in IBM i (formerly known as AS/400 or iSeries) environments, which are often used in industries such as finance, manufacturing, and healthcare.

"Many computer applications involve the arrival of a set of data that must be processed in a specified way.  For example, a bank’s ATM system receives a customer’s request to deposit money together with identification of the account and the amount to be deposited.  The system must accept the deposit, update the account balance, and return a receipt to the customer.  This is an example of real-time transaction processing. Some applications process transactions in batches.  For example, a company may run a program once a month that generates paychecks and withholding stubs from employee records that include hours worked, number of dependents claimed, and so on.  Indeed, in the ATM example, the account balance is typically not updated during the on-line transaction, but instead a batch transaction is stored.  Overnight that transaction will be processed together with other transactions affecting that account (such as checks), and the balance will then be officially updated.

"NLP is a multidisciplinary field that draws from linguistics and computer science, particularly artificial intelligence ,.  In terms of linguistics, a program must be able to deal with words that have multiple meanings (“wind up the clock” and “the wind is cold today”) as well as grammatical ambiguities (in the phrase “little girl’s school” is it the school that is little, the girls, or both?).  Of course each language has its own forms of ambiguity. Programs can use several strategies for dealing with these problems, including using statistical models to predict the likely meaning of a given phrase based on a “corpus” of existing text in that language ,. As formidable as the task of extracting the correct (literal) meaning from text can be, it is really only the first level of natural language processing.  If a program is to successfully summarize or draw conclusions about a news report from North Korea, for example, it would also have to have a knowledge base of facts about that country and/or a set of “frames” , about how to interpret various situations such as threat, bluff, or compromise. )",0,222,1112,6,125,0.5630630630630631,0.4144144144144144,4.157657657657658,37.0,41.349631147541004,15.068934426229507,18.53879781420765,15.688483145680365,11.246994535519129,0.3963963963963964,0.23214285714285715,0.08482142857142858,0.08482142857142858,0.044642857142857144,0.11160714285714286,0.05357142857142857,4,0.018018018018018018,13,0,0,0,1,0.06306306306306306,0,2

"Typewriters are mechanical or electromechanical devices used for writing or printing text on paper.  They were commonly used for typing documents, letters, and other written materials before the advent of personal computers and printers. Typewriters were first invented in the 19th century, and they quickly became popular due to their ability to produce legible, professional-looking documents.  Early typewriters were purely mechanical, with keys that pressed inked ribbons against paper to create the desired characters.  Later models added electric power to speed up the typing process and eliminate the need for manual carriage returns. Typewriters were once a common fixture in offices, schools, and other institutions, but they have largely been replaced by digital technology.  However, some people still use typewriters for their unique aesthetic and tactile experience.  In recent years, there has been a resurgence of interest in typewriters among writers, artists, and collectors",1,163,991,8,106,0.6503067484662577,0.5214723926380368,5.171779141104294,20.375,29.35250000000002,13.636944444444445,16.644444444444446,15.247664890283005,15.704166666666662,0.3496932515337423,0.25882352941176473,0.1,0.11176470588235295,0.052941176470588235,0.11176470588235295,0.052941176470588235,3,0.018404907975460124,12,0,0,0,0,0.0736196319018405,1,1

"Scheduling multiprocessor systems refer to computer systems that have multiple processors or cores that can perform parallel processing.  These systems are designed to handle complex and resource-intensive tasks that cannot be efficiently executed on a single processor system. In a scheduling multiprocessor system, the operating system is responsible for assigning tasks or processes to different processors or cores for parallel execution.  This is done through a scheduling algorithm that determines which process should be executed by which processor at a given time. The goal of scheduling in a multiprocessor system is to optimize the use of available resources and minimize the time required to complete a given set of tasks.  There are various scheduling algorithms used in multiprocessor systems, including Round Robin, First Come First Serve, and Priority Scheduling. Multiprocessor systems are commonly used in applications such as scientific computing, data processing, and real-time systems that require high performance and reliability.  They are also used in servers, supercomputers, and high-end workstations for demanding applications such as simulation, modeling, and analysis.",1,189,1196,8,100,0.5291005291005291,0.3492063492063492,5.412698412698413,23.625,15.070955882352962,16.436323529411762,21.676470588235293,18.377959752453624,16.992941176470598,0.36507936507936506,0.2864321608040201,0.1306532663316583,0.08040201005025126,0.01507537688442211,0.09547738693467336,0.05527638190954774,3,0.015873015873015872,10,0,0,0,0,0.05291005291005291,0,2

"n computing, cache refers to a high-speed data storage layer that stores recently used data and instructions to provide faster access to that data in the future. When data is requested by a program, the computer first checks if the data is available in the cache memory.  If it is, the computer retrieves the data from the cache instead of going to the original source, such as the hard drive or network, which is slower.  This results in faster access to frequently used data, which in turn improves the overall performance of the computer system. Caches can be found in many different parts of a computer system, including the processor, hard drive, and web browser.

"RAID stands for ""Redundant Array of Independent Disks"".  It is a technology that involves combining multiple physical disk drives into a single logical unit to improve data performance, reliability, or both. There are several different RAID levels, each with its own characteristics and benefits.  The most common RAID levels are:RAID 0: This level stripes data across multiple drives for improved performance, but provides no redundancy.  If one drive fails, all data is lost. RAID 1: This level mirrors data across multiple drives for improved redundancy, but provides no performance benefits.  If one drive fails, data is still accessible from the remaining drives. RAID 5: This level stripes data across multiple drives and also includes parity information, allowing for one drive to fail without data loss. RAID 6: This level is similar to RAID 5, but includes two sets of parity information, allowing for two drives to fail without data loss. Other RAID levels, such as RAID 10, RAID 50, and RAID 60, combine aspects of these basic levels to provide different trade-offs between performance and redundancy. RAID is commonly used in enterprise and server environments to ensure data availability, but can also be used in personal computers for improved performance and data protection.",1,237,1290,11,111,0.46835443037974683,0.28270042194092826,4.582278481012659,21.545454545454547,41.824818629646245,12.01022839229736,14.869502910882222,14.02287970970757,12.596059113300495,0.27848101265822783,0.23868312757201646,0.10699588477366255,0.09876543209876543,0.0205761316872428,0.09053497942386832,0.03292181069958848,11,0.046413502109704644,15,0,5,0,0,0.06329113924050633,0,3
"Digital Rights Management (DRM) is a technology that is used to protect and manage digital content, such as music, videos, e-books, and software.  DRM is designed to prevent unauthorized access, copying, distribution, and modification of digital content. DRM typically involves the use of encryption and other technologies to control access to digital content and enforce usage restrictions.  For example, DRM may limit the number of devices that a user can access content on, restrict the amount of time content can be accessed, or prevent users from sharing or copying the content. DRM can be implemented in a variety of ways, depending on the type of digital content and the business model of the content provider.  For example, some music and video streaming services use DRM to prevent users from downloading and sharing content, while e-book providers may use DRM to restrict access to their content to specific devices or apps. While DRM can be effective in protecting digital content and ensuring that content creators and distributors are fairly compensated for their work, it has also been criticized for limiting user rights and freedoms.  Some critics argue that DRM can be overly restrictive and may interfere with users' ability to access and use digital content in legitimate ways.",1,232,1296,8,106,0.45689655172413796,0.3017241379310345,4.681034482758621,29.0,32.62404891304348,15.136998792270536,19.045652173913044,16.678067442207542,12.728502415458937,0.3577586206896552,0.275,0.13333333333333333,0.05416666666666667,0.016666666666666666,0.09583333333333334,0.075,9,0.03879310344827586,14,0,0,0,0,0.0603448275862069,0,2

"Internationalization and localization are two related concepts that are important for adapting software and other digital products to different languages, cultures, and regions. Internationalization (often abbreviated as i18n) is the process of designing and developing software so that it can be easily adapted to different languages and regions.  This involves separating the user interface text and other content from the software code, so that it can be translated and localized without modifying the underlying code.  Internationalization also involves addressing other cultural and technical differences, such as date and time formats, numeric conventions, and character sets. Localization (often abbreviated as l10n) is the process of adapting software to a specific language or region, taking into account the cultural and linguistic differences of the target audience.  This involves translating the user interface text, as well as adapting other content and features to meet the needs and expectations of the local audience.  Localization can also involve testing and validating the localized product to ensure that it is fully functional and meets the quality standards of the target market.

"A wiki is a collaborative website that allows users to create, edit, and link web pages easily.  The structure of a wiki typically consists of the following elements:Pages: A wiki is made up of individual pages, each of which can contain text, images, links, and other media.  Pages can be created, edited, and deleted by users with appropriate permissions. Links: Pages in a wiki are connected through links, which allow users to navigate from one page to another.  Links can be created within a page or between pages, and they often form a web of interconnected information. Navigation: A wiki typically has a navigation system that allows users to browse through pages and find the information they need.  Navigation can take the form of a table of contents, a search bar, or a hierarchical menu. History: One of the defining features of a wiki is its revision history.  Every change made to a page is recorded, allowing users to see who made what changes and when.  This makes it easy to track the evolution of a page over time and to undo mistakes or vandalism. Categories: Categories are a way of organizing pages in a wiki.  Pages can be assigned to one or more categories, which helps users find related content and facilitates maintenance and cleanup of the wiki.

"Telecommuting, also known as teleworking or remote work, refers to the practice of working from a location other than a traditional office or workplace, such as from home or a remote location, using technology to communicate with colleagues and complete job tasks. Telecommuting has become increasingly popular in recent years due to advances in technology that have made remote work more feasible and efficient.  Some of the benefits of telecommuting include:Increased flexibility: Telecommuting allows workers to work from anywhere with an internet connection, providing greater flexibility and control over their work schedules. Cost savings: Telecommuting can save workers money on transportation, parking, and other costs associated with commuting to an office or workplace. Increased productivity: Telecommuting has been shown to increase productivity in some cases, as workers are often less distracted and can focus more on their work tasks without the distractions of a traditional office environment. Better work-life balance: Telecommuting can help workers achieve a better work-life balance, as it allows them to spend more time with family and pursue personal interests while still meeting work obligations. Reduced environmental impact: Telecommuting can help reduce the environmental impact of commuting, as it reduces the number of cars on the road and the associated emissions. While there are many benefits to telecommuting, it is important to note that it may not be suitable for all types of jobs or workers.  It can also pose challenges in terms of communication, collaboration, and maintaining a sense of community among remote workers.",1,277,1658,9,140,0.5054151624548736,0.3285198555956679,5.086642599277979,30.77777777777778,20.24111111111111,17.28166666666667,19.409318996415774,17.251386760058843,15.376612903225805,0.37545126353790614,0.2756183745583039,0.127208480565371,0.09540636042402827,0.03180212014134275,0.12367491166077739,0.045936395759717315,1,0.0036101083032490976,13,0,6,0,0,0.04693140794223827,0,7

"Port scanning is a technique used to discover open ports and services on a computer or network device.  A port is a communication endpoint in a network device, and each service or application running on the device typically uses a specific port to communicate with other devices on the network. Port scanning works by sending a series of network packets to a target device, each packet attempting to establish a connection on a different port.  If a connection is successful, the scanner can determine the port status (open, closed, or filtered) and potentially identify the service or application running on the port. Port scanning can be used for legitimate purposes, such as network management and security testing, but it can also be used for malicious activities, such as identifying vulnerable services or attempting to gain unauthorized access to a network. Network administrators and security professionals often use port scanning tools to identify open ports and services on their own networks, and to detect and prevent port scanning attempts by unauthorized users.",1,188,1075,6,89,0.4734042553191489,0.30319148936170215,4.803191489361702,31.333333333333332,26.02328947368423,16.709795321637426,19.353216374269007,17.122413403193683,13.21286549707602,0.3829787234042553,0.3157894736842105,0.12105263157894737,0.08421052631578947,0.021052631578947368,0.08947368421052632,0.042105263157894736,0,0.0,9,0,0,0,0,0.047872340425531915,0,0

"ADSL (Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line) is a type of broadband internet connection technology that uses existing copper telephone lines to transmit digital data at high speeds.  ADSL allows users to access the internet and other online services while still being able to make phone calls on the same line. ADSL is ""asymmetric"" because it allows for faster download speeds than upload speeds.  This is because it is designed to accommodate the typical internet usage patterns of most people, who tend to download more data than they upload.  In an ADSL connection, the bandwidth is divided into two channels, with one channel being used for downloading data at high speeds, while the other channel is used for uploading data at lower speeds. ADSL requires a special modem to be installed on the user's premises, which communicates with the internet service provider's (ISP) equipment at the telephone exchange.  The modem uses a technology called frequency division multiplexing (FDM) to separate the voice and data signals on the same phone line. ADSL is widely available and is one of the most popular types of broadband internet connections worldwide.  It is generally less expensive than other high-speed internet options like fiber-optic internet and cable internet, and it is suitable for many common online activities, such as web browsing, streaming video and audio, and online gaming.  However, ADSL speeds can be affected by factors like the distance from the user's premises to the telephone exchange and the quality of the phone line, which can result in slower speeds in some cases.",1,288,1596,10,142,0.4930555555555556,0.3090277777777778,4.642361111111111,28.8,36.766625000000005,14.490875000000003,17.115000000000002,15.774802946060372,12.51953125,0.3645833333333333,0.28859060402684567,0.09395973154362416,0.1040268456375839,0.02348993288590604,0.09731543624161074,0.053691275167785234,8,0.027777777777777776,11,0,0,0,0,0.03819444444444445,1,2

Some of the key issues are:Security: One of the biggest challenges for modern operating systems is ensuring security against malware, viruses, and other cyber threats.  Designers need to implement robust security measures to protect against attacks and ensure that user data is safe. Performance: Modern operating systems need to be fast and responsive, with low latency and minimal resource usage.  This requires careful optimization of system resources, such as memory, CPU, and I/O operations. Compatibility: Operating systems need to be compatible with a wide range of hardware and software configurations.  Designers need to ensure that the operating system can work seamlessly with different hardware devices, including printers, scanners, and other peripherals. Usability: Operating systems should be intuitive and easy to use, with a consistent interface that users can navigate easily.  Designers need to ensure that the user experience is positive and that users can easily access the features and functions they need. Updates and maintenance: Operating systems need to be updated regularly to fix bugs and security vulnerabilities, and designers need to ensure that these updates are delivered seamlessly and without disrupting the user experience. Privacy: Operating systems should also protect the user's privacy and personal data.  Designers need to implement privacy settings and features that give users control over their personal data and limit access to sensitive information. Accessibility: Operating systems should also be designed to be accessible to users with disabilities.  Designers need to ensure that users with vision, hearing, or mobility impairments can use the operating system effectively.

"Affiliate marketing is a type of online marketing in which a business or advertiser pays a commission to a third-party affiliate for promoting and driving traffic to their products or services.  It is a performance-based marketing strategy that involves four main parties: the advertiser, the affiliate, the customer, and the network. In affiliate marketing, the advertiser provides the affiliate with promotional materials, such as banner ads or product links, to use in their marketing efforts.  The affiliate then promotes the advertiser's products or services to their audience, such as on their website or social media channels.  When a customer clicks on the affiliate's promotional link and makes a purchase, the affiliate earns a commission from the advertiser. Affiliate marketing can be beneficial for all parties involved.  Advertisers can reach new customers and increase their sales without having to invest in traditional advertising methods.  Affiliates can earn money by promoting products or services that align with their brand and audience.  Customers can discover new products or services that they may not have found otherwise. Affiliate marketing can be used in a variety of industries, including e-commerce, travel, finance, and more.  There are different types of affiliate marketing programs, including pay-per-click (PPC), pay-per-lead (PPL), and pay-per-sale (PPS).  It is important for both advertisers and affiliates to choose the right program and set clear expectations for commission rates, performance metrics, and marketing guidelines. Overall, affiliate marketing is a popular and effective way for businesses to reach new customers and increase their sales, while providing affiliates with a way to monetize their online presence and promote products or services they believe in.",1,309,1815,13,140,0.45307443365695793,0.3074433656957929,4.983818770226537,23.76923076923077,29.968593570608505,14.200746268656719,18.544661308840414,16.850672712058472,15.010447761194037,0.37216828478964403,0.2955223880597015,0.11044776119402985,0.0626865671641791,0.008955223880597015,0.08358208955223881,0.03880597014925373,5,0.016181229773462782,19,0,1,0,0,0.061488673139158574,0,2

"The dot-matrix printer, which came into common use in the 1980s, uses a different principle of operation than typewriter-style printers.  Unlike the latter, the dot-matrix printer does not form solid characters.  Instead, it uses an array of magnetically controlled pins (9 pins at first, but 24 on later models).  Each character is formed by pressing the appropriate pins into a ribbon that pushes into the paper, leaving a pattern of tiny dots. Besides being relatively inexpensive, dot-matrix printers are versatile in that a great variety of character styles or fonts can be printed ,, either by loading different sets of bitmaps.  Likewise, graphic images can also be printed.

"Digital Rights Management (DRM) refers to a set of technologies and techniques used to control access to and usage of digital content, such as music, movies, and ebooks. DRM is used to protect the intellectual property rights of content creators and distributors by preventing unauthorized copying, sharing, and distribution of digital content.  It typically involves encryption and digital watermarking techniques that are applied to the content to prevent it from being copied or used without permission. DRM can take different forms, such as password protection, digital certificates, and software that controls access to the content.  Some DRM technologies require users to be connected to the internet in order to access the content, and may limit the number of times that the content can be accessed or shared. While DRM can help protect the intellectual property rights of content creators and distributors, it has been criticized for limiting the rights of users to access and use digital content that they have purchased.

"The data acquisition system begins with a transducer, which is a device that converts a physical phenomenon (such as heat) into a proportional electrical signal.  Transducers include devices such as thermistors, thermocouples, and pressure or strain gauges.  The output of the transducer is then fed into a signal conditioning circuit.  The purpose of signal conditioning is to make sure the signal fits into the range needed by the data processing device.  Thus the signal may be amplified or its voltage may be adjusted or scaled to the required level.  Another function of signal conditioning is to isolate the incoming signal from the computer to which the acquisition device is connected.  This is necessary both to protect the delicate computer circuits from possible “spikes” in the incoming signal and to prevent “noise” (extraneous electromagnetic signals created by the computer itself) from distorting the signal, and thus the ultimate measurements.  Various sorts of filters can be added for this purpose.",0,178,1017,8,95,0.5337078651685393,0.3539325842696629,4.792134831460674,22.25,34.72292721518991,13.322626582278485,16.760759493670886,15.414825405933506,13.279746835443035,0.4044943820224719,0.2648648648648649,0.10270270270270271,0.08108108108108109,0.016216216216216217,0.0972972972972973,0.06486486486486487,2,0.011235955056179775,4,0,0,0,0,0.02247191011235955,2,5

"The ergonomics of computing is the study of how to design and arrange computer workstations and other computer-related equipment to optimize human comfort, safety, and efficiency while using computers.  It involves designing computer equipment and workspaces in a way that reduces the risk of injury, strain, or discomfort caused by repetitive movements, poor posture, or other factors. Ergonomics is an important consideration in computing because prolonged use of computers can lead to a range of physical and mental health issues, such as eye strain, back and neck pain, carpal tunnel syndrome, and stress.

"Disk cache is a mechanism used by computer operating systems to improve disk I/O (input/output) performance. When a program reads data from a disk, the operating system caches the data in memory, so that the next time the program needs to access the same data, it can be retrieved quickly from memory instead of having to read it from the disk again.  Similarly, when a program writes data to a disk, the operating system caches the data in memory and writes it to the disk at a later time when it is more efficient to do so. The disk cache can be either a dedicated portion of RAM or a portion of the hard drive that has been set aside for this purpose.  By caching frequently accessed data in memory, the operating system can reduce the amount of time spent waiting for disk I/O operations, which can improve overall system performance.",1,165,838,5,78,0.4727272727272727,0.28484848484848485,4.157575757575757,33.0,45.08001324503314,14.474092715231787,17.113112582781458,14.265292616868656,8.91655629139073,0.43636363636363634,0.28901734104046245,0.11560693641618497,0.04046242774566474,0.046242774566473986,0.09826589595375723,0.057803468208092484,1,0.006060606060606061,7,0,0,0,0,0.04242424242424243,0,0

However, it wasn't until the 1970s when the first computer chess tournament was held, and the first commercially available computer chess program, Chess 4. 0, was released. Since then, computer chess has made significant progress, and today, the best computer chess programs can easily defeat even the most skilled human players.  This progress has been driven by advances in hardware and software, as well as improvements in AI techniques such as search algorithms, game tree pruning, and machine learning.

"Digital Video Recording (DVR) is a technology that allows users to record, store, and playback digital video content.  DVRs are commonly used in home entertainment systems, security systems, and other applications where video recording is required. A typical DVR consists of a digital tuner, a hard drive for storing recorded video content, and software for managing and playing back recorded content.  The digital tuner is used to receive television signals, which are then recorded onto the hard drive for later playback.

"Traditionally documents such as advertisements, brochures, and reports were prepared by combining typed or printed text with pasted-in illustrations (such as photographs and diagrams).  This painstaking layout process was necessary in order to produce “camera-ready copy” from which a printing company could produce the final product. Starting in the late 1980s, desktop computers became powerful enough to run software that could be used to create page layouts.  In addition, display hardware gained a high enough resolution to allow for pages to be shown on the screen in much the same form as they would appear on the printed page.  (This is known by the acronym WYSIWYG, or “what you see is what you get. ”) The final ingredient for the creation of desktop publishing was the advent of affordable laser or inkjet printers that could print near print quality text and high-resolution graphics",0,160,895,6,104,0.65,0.4375,4.6875,26.666666666666668,44.59361502347417,12.918873239436621,15.100469483568077,14.06817628641468,12.725352112676056,0.36875,0.2603550295857988,0.1301775147928994,0.08284023668639054,0.01775147928994083,0.10059171597633136,0.0650887573964497,2,0.0125,5,0,0,0,0,0.03125,0,3

"All of the sorting algorithms discussed so far rely upon some form of comparison.  However, it also possible to sort records by calculating their relative positions or distribution ,.  In its simplest form, an array can be created whose range of indexes is equal to 1 to the maximum possible key value.  Each key is then stored in the index position equal to its value (that is, a record with a key of 2314 would be stored in the array at position Array[2314].  This procedure works well, but only if the keys are all integers, the range is small enough to fit in memory, and there are no duplicate keys (since a duplicate would in effect overwrite the record already stored in that position). A more practical approach is to use a formula (hash function) that should create a unique hash value for each key.  The function must be chosen to minimize “collisions” where two keys end up with the same hash value, which creates the same problem as with duplicate keys.  A hash sort is quite efficient within those constraints",0,205,1022,8,115,0.5609756097560976,0.3902439024390244,4.078048780487805,25.625,56.15750000000001,11.016111111111112,14.333333333333336,13.81666964889586,9.04888888888889,0.4097560975609756,0.22009569377990432,0.09090909090909091,0.07655502392344497,0.05263157894736842,0.10526315789473684,0.07177033492822966,3,0.014634146341463415,8,0,0,0,0,0.03902439024390244,1,2

"The explosive growth of the World Wide Web has confronted programmers with the need to find ways to link databases and other existing resources to Web sites.  The specifications for such linkages are found in the Common Gateway Interface ,.  However, the early facilities for writing CGI scripts were awkward and often frustrating to use. Back in 1986, UNIX developer Larry Wall had created a language called Perl (Practical Extraction and Report Language).  There were already ways to write scripts for simple data processing , as well as a handy pattern-manipulation language ,.  However, Wall wanted to provide a greater variety of functions and techniques for finding, extracting, and formatting data.  Perl attracted a following within the UNIX community.  Since much Web development was being done on UNIX-based systems by the mid- and late-1990s, it was natural that many webmasters and applications programmers would turn to Perl to write their CGI scripts. As with many UNIX scripting languages, Perl’s syntax is broadly similar to C.  However, the philosophy behind C is to provide a sparse core language with most functionality being handled by standard or add-in program libraries.  Perl, on the other hand, starts with most of the functionality of UNIX utilities such as sed (stream editor), C shell, and awk, including the powerful regular expressions familiar to UNIX users.  The language also includes a “hash” data type (a collection of paired keys and values) that makes it easy for a program to maintain and check lists such as of Internet hosts and their IP addresses ,.",0,291,1590,11,161,0.5532646048109966,0.40893470790378006,4.553264604810996,26.454545454545453,44.992728919631105,12.221432806324113,15.073649538866931,14.554592549557764,12.185770750988144,0.3333333333333333,0.2262295081967213,0.10819672131147541,0.08524590163934426,0.03278688524590164,0.10163934426229508,0.036065573770491806,15,0.05154639175257732,17,0,0,0,0,0.058419243986254296,3,0

"Fuzzy logic is a mathematical framework for dealing with uncertainty and imprecision in decision-making.  Unlike traditional logic, which deals with ""crisp"" or binary values (true or false, 0 or 1), fuzzy logic allows for values that are partially true or partially false. Fuzzy logic is based on the idea of ""fuzzy sets,"" which are sets that allow for degrees of membership.  For example, in a traditional set, an element is either a member or it is not.  But in a fuzzy set, an element can have a degree of membership between 0 and 1.  For example, the statement ""the temperature is hot"" could be assigned a degree of membership based on how hot it is.",1,136,654,6,66,0.4852941176470588,0.22794117647058823,3.985294117647059,22.666666666666668,52.756485507246396,10.662391304347828,13.579710144927539,13.023866798666859,8.528695652173912,0.40441176470588236,0.20279720279720279,0.055944055944055944,0.11188811188811189,0.013986013986013986,0.1258741258741259,0.07692307692307693,4,0.029411764705882353,8,0,0,0,0,0.058823529411764705,0,2

"The  arithmetic  logic  unit  is  the  part  of  a  computer  system that actually performs calculations and logical comparisons on data.  It is part of the central processing unit (CPU), and in  practice  there  may  be  separate  and  multiple  arithmetic and logic units ,. The ALU works by first retrieving a code that represents the operation to be performed (such as ADD).  The code also specifies the location from which the data is to be retrieved and  to  which  the  results  of  the  operation  are  to  be  stored.  (For example, addition of the data from memory to a num-ber  already  stored  in  a  special  accumulator  register  within the CPU, with the result to be stored back into the accumu-lator. )  The  operation  code  can  also  include  a  specification of the format of the data to be used (such as fixed or float-ing-point  numbers)—the  operation  and  format  are  often combined into the same code. In  addition  to  arithmetic  operations,  the  ALU  can  also carry  out  logical  comparisons,  such  as  bitwise  operations that compare corresponding bits in two data words, corresponding to Boolean operators such as AND, OR, and xOR ,. The  data  or  operand  specified  in  the  operation  code  is retrieved as words of memory that represent numeric data, or  indirectly,  character  data  ,.  Once the operation is per-formed,  the  result  is  stored  (typically  in  a  register  in  the CPU).   Special  codes  are  also  stored  in  registers  to  indicate characteristics  of  the  result  (such  as  whether  it  is  positive, negative,  or  zero).   Other  special  conditions  called  excep-tions  indicate  a  problem  with  the  processing.   Common exceptions include overflow, where the result fills more bits than are available in the register, loss of precision (because there  isn’t  room  to  store  the  necessary  number  of  decimal places),  or  an  attempt  to  divide  by  zero.   Exceptions  are typically  indicated  by  setting  a  flag  in  the  machine  status register.",0,357,2036,13,147,0.4117647058823529,0.25770308123249297,4.394957983193278,27.46153846153846,34.46263236763238,14.338311688311688,17.78861138861139,16.290370192383524,11.479870129870129,0.4117647058823529,0.17567567567567569,0.06563706563706563,0.05019305019305019,0.025096525096525095,0.08301158301158301,0.04247104247104247,8,0.022408963585434174,19,0,0,0,0,0.05322128851540616,0,0

"The PHP processor parses only the code within the delimiters <? and ?>.  (An alternative set of delimiters is <script language =‘php’> </script>. Besides being embedded in HTML pages, PHP can be used interactively at the command line, where it has replaced older languages such as awk, Perl, or shell scripting for many users.  PHP can also be linked to user-interface libraries (such as GTK+ for Linux/UNIX) to create applications that run on the client machine rather than the server.

Additionally, PHP5 provides full support for objects, including private and protected member variables, constructors and destructors, and other features similar to those found in C++ and other languages. There are numerous libraries of open-source objects and functions that enable PHP scripts to perform common Internet tasks, including accessing database servers (such as MySQL) as well as extensions to the language to handle popular Web formats such as Adobe Flash animation.

"With simple rules but endless permutations, chess has fascinated millions of players for hundreds of years.  When mechanical automatons became fashionable in the 18th century, onlookers were intrigued by “the Turk,” a chessplaying automaton.  While the Turk was eventually shown to be a hoax (a human player was hidden inside), the development of the electronic digital computer in the mid-20th century provided the opportunity to create a true automatic chess player. In 1950 Claude Shannon outlined the two basic strategies that would be used by future chess-playing programs.  The “brute force” strategy would examine the possible moves for the computer chess player, the possible replies of the opponent to each move, the possible next moves by the computer, and so on for as many half moves or “plies” as possible.  The moves would be evaluated by a “minimax” algorithm that would find the move that best improves the computer’s position despite the opponent’s best play.",0,182,976,6,102,0.5604395604395604,0.4065934065934066,4.4945054945054945,30.333333333333332,37.06706989247314,14.506935483870969,18.333333333333332,16.92669308720184,12.652903225806455,0.3516483516483517,0.22580645161290322,0.08064516129032258,0.11827956989247312,0.03225806451612903,0.0913978494623656,0.05913978494623656,9,0.04945054945054945,7,0,0,0,0,0.038461538461538464,0,1
"Firewall consists of a set of related programs‚ located at a network gateway server.  A firewall is a combination of hardware and software used toimplement a security policy governing the network traffic between two ormore networks.  Some of that traffic may be under the administrator’s control(e. g. ‚ organization’s networks) and some of which may be out of the systemadministrator’s control (e. g. ‚ the Internet). Firewalls determine whether to block or allow network traffic by lookingat TCP7IP packet headers to determine if these are in accordance with predetermined security policy.  However‚ a firewall does neither have the capabilityto recognize malicious code (Malware‚ Virus)‚ nor any means for preventingits transfer to a target system. A Firewall usually protects the resources of a private network from usersfrom other networks.  A network firewall commonly serves as a primary lineof defense against external threats to an organization’s computer systems‚networks‚ and critical information.  Firewalls can also be used to partition anorganization’s internal networks‚ reducing the risk from insider attacks. There are three types of firewalls:Pack Filter—filters the contents of the IP packet header‚ therefore‚ limited tothe source and destination address as well as the TCP/UDP port number.  Filterdoes not check content of message/data;Circuit Filter or Circuit Level Gateway—applies packet filtering but verifiesinformation based on TCP or UDP packet header information as well.  Hence‚it can make a better decision if the individual packets form part of a valid TCPsequence.  Creates a handshake‚ and once that takes place passes everythingthrough until the session is ended.  Still it has no knowledge of which user isrequesting access to services; andApplication Filter—uses proxies to apply filter rules based on the data contentand sometimes the user.  A dedicated program called a ‘proxy’ or ‘proxy server’is used to effect the application filter policy rules.  Commonly used applicationfilter is the web proxy.  It can be used to restrict the internal (or Intranet) webpages that are published out to the internet ,.",0,365,2145,16,204,0.5589041095890411,0.410958904109589,4.972602739726027,22.8125,34.56351079672376,13.056247207743858,15.156813104988835,14.038888211671637,14.837974683544306,0.3506849315068493,0.2805194805194805,0.1012987012987013,0.046753246753246755,0.03636363636363636,0.08311688311688312,0.03896103896103896,25,0.0684931506849315,1,2,1,0,0,0.00821917808219178,3,7
"A plug-in, also known as an add-on, extension, or module, is a software component that adds specific functionality to an existing software application.  Plug-ins are typically designed to work with a specific application or platform, and can be installed or removed independently of the main application. Plug-ins can be used to extend the functionality of web browsers, multimedia players, image editors, and other software applications.  For example, a web browser might have a plug-in that enables it to display Adobe Flash content, while an image editor might have a plug-in that adds support for a new image file format. Plug-ins are often developed by third-party developers, and are usually distributed as separate downloads.  They can be installed manually by the user, or they may be installed automatically when the user installs or updates the main application. Some of the benefits of plug-ins include:Customizability: Plug-ins allow users to customize the functionality of their software applications to better suit their needs. Flexibility: Plug-ins can be added or removed without affecting the core functionality of the main application. Modularity: Plug-ins are designed to work independently of the main application, making it easier to develop and maintain software. Innovation: Plug-ins enable developers to add new features and capabilities to existing applications, promoting innovation and creativity. Overall, plug-ins are an important tool for extending the functionality of software applications, and have played an important role in the development of modern software platforms.",1,270,1605,11,121,0.44814814814814813,0.2851851851851852,5.059259259259259,24.545454545454547,21.120794016110466,15.665891829689304,17.900882240122748,16.24694786949722,15.129957805907182,0.35555555555555557,0.26578073089701,0.12624584717607973,0.053156146179401995,0.03322259136212625,0.07308970099667775,0.06312292358803986,2,0.007407407407407408,16,0,5,0,0,0.05925925925925926,0,3

"When videotape first became available in the 1950s, recorders cost thousands of dollars and could only be afforded by TV studios.  Today the VCR is inexpensive and ubiquitous.  However, it is hard to edit videotape.  Tape is a linear medium, meaning that to find a given piece of video the tape has to be moved to that spot.  Removing or adding something involves either physically splicing the tape (as is done with film) or more commonly, feeding in tape from two or more recorders onto a destination tape.  Besides being tedious and limited in capabilities, “linear editing” by copying loses a bit of quality with each copying operation. Today, however, it is easy to shoot video in digital form , or to convert analog video into digital form.  Digital video is a stream of data that represents sampling of the source signal, such as from the chargecoupled device (CCD) that turns light photons into electron flow in a digital camera or digital camcorder.  This process involves either software or hardware compression for storage and decompression for viewing and editing (such a scheme is called a CODEC for “compression/decompression”).  The most widely used formats include DV (Digital Video) and MPEG (Motion Picture Expert Group), which has versions that vary in the amount of compression and thus fidelity",0,248,1315,10,135,0.5443548387096774,0.38306451612903225,4.403225806451613,24.8,37.45436046511631,13.37639534883721,17.34418604651163,15.774802946060372,11.364651162790697,0.3588709677419355,0.2364341085271318,0.10852713178294573,0.06589147286821706,0.03875968992248062,0.10077519379844961,0.04263565891472868,14,0.056451612903225805,10,0,0,0,0,0.04032258064516129,3,0

"Early computer printers were limited to one or a few built-in fonts, either stamped on typewriter style keys on daisy wheels, or stored as patterns in the printer’s software (with dot matrix printers).  In the mid-1970s, when Xerox researchers were developing the laser printer, they realized they needed an actual programming language that could describe fonts, graphics, and other elements that could be printed on the more versatile new printers.  PARC researchers developed InterPress; meanwhile two of them, John Warnock and Chuck Geschke, founded their own company in 1982 ,.  They then created a more streamlined version of InterPress that they called PostScript.  The first printer to include built-in PostScript capability was Apple’s LaserWriter, in 1985.  PostScript soon became the standard for a burgeoning industry ,. Because PostScript is an actual programming language (for a somewhat similar language, see Forth), software such as word processors can include functions that turn a text document into a PostScript document, ready for printing.  A PostScript interpreter in the printer (or even in another application) interprets the PostScript commands to re-create the document.  The commands specify rasters (combinations of straight lines and curves), which can be scaled and transformed to provide the specified output, including fonts, which can be enhanced by including “hints” to help the system identify key features.  This processor is thus sometimes called a Raster Image Processor (RIP)",0,267,1513,10,151,0.5655430711610487,0.4044943820224719,4.790262172284645,26.7,44.877500000000026,12.589444444444442,15.577777777777778,14.410869940926823,14.694222222222223,0.3333333333333333,0.2,0.12857142857142856,0.05714285714285714,0.03214285714285714,0.08214285714285714,0.04642857142857143,24,0.0898876404494382,17,1,0,0,0,0.06741573033707865,1,3
"Wary users have a number of ways to reduce their chance of being “phished. ” Some signs of bogus messages include:, The message is addressed generically (“dear PayPal user”) or to the user’s e-mail address rather than the account name. , The text of the message contains spelling errors or poor grammar. , The URL shown for a link in the message (perhaps via a “tool tip”) does not match the institution’s real Web address. Fortunately there are ways in which software can help detect and block most phishing attempts.  A good spam filter is the first line of defense and can block many phishing messages from getting to the user in the first place.  Anti-phishing features are also increasingly included in Web browsers, or available as plug-ins.  Thus “blacklists” of known phishing sites can be checked in real time and warnings given, or the site’s address can be blocked from access by the system.  Web sites can also introduce an added layer of security: Bank of America, for example, asks users to select and label one of several images offered by the bank.

"A device driver is a software program that allows the operating system to communicate with and control a specific hardware device such as a printer, scanner, or graphics card.  Device drivers act as a bridge between the hardware device and the operating system, enabling the device to perform its intended functions. When a device is first installed or connected to a computer, the operating system checks to see if a compatible driver is already installed.  If it is not, the operating system will prompt the user to install the necessary driver software.  Once installed, the device driver allows the operating system to interact with the device, sending and receiving data and commands as needed. Device drivers are specific to the hardware they control and are often updated to fix bugs or add new features.

"The file system is the facility of the operating system that organizes files ,.  For example, on DOS and older Windows PCs, there is a file allocation table (FAT) that consists of a linked list of clusters (each cluster consists of a fixed number of sectors, varying with the overall size of the disk).  When the operating system is asked to access a file, it can go through the table and find the clusters belonging to that file, read the data and send it to the requesting applica-tio n.   modern  file  systems  further  organize  files  into  groups called folders or directories, which can be nested several lay-ers  deep.   Such  a  hierarchical  file  system  makes  it  easier  for users to organize the dozens of applications and thousands of files found on today’s PCs.  For example, a folder called Book might have a subfolder for each chapter, which in turn con-tains folders for text and illustrations relating to that chapter.",0,177,940,5,97,0.5480225988700564,0.3785310734463277,4.293785310734464,35.4,48.256725053078554,13.029012738853506,15.816985138004249,13.81666964889586,10.295541401273887,0.4011299435028249,0.26108374384236455,0.11822660098522167,0.03940886699507389,0.0049261083743842365,0.10344827586206896,0.029556650246305417,6,0.03389830508474576,9,0,0,0,0,0.05084745762711865,0,0
"Typically, a wireless LAN uses a frequency band with each unit on a slightly different frequency, thus allowing all units to communicate without interference.  (Although radio frequency is now most popular, wireless LANs can also use microwave links, which are sometimes used as an alternative to Ethernet cable in large facilities. )Usually there is a network access point, a PC that contains a transceiver and serves as the network hub (it may also serve as a bridge between the wireless network and a wired LAN).  The hub computer can also be connected to a high-speed Internet service via DSL or cable.  It has an antenna allowing it to communicate with wireless PCs up to several hundred feet away, depending on building configuration. Each computer on the wireless network has an adapter with a transceiver so it can communicate with the access point.

"Network cache is a mechanism used to improve network performance by storing frequently accessed data closer to the user or application, rather than retrieving it repeatedly from a remote server. Network cache can operate at different levels, such as in web browsers, content delivery networks (CDNs), and proxy servers.  For example, web browsers use a cache to store web pages, images, and other resources that are frequently accessed by the user, so that they can be retrieved quickly without having to download them from the internet again.  CDNs use a network of servers located in different regions to cache content, so that users can access it from a server that is geographically closer to them, reducing the latency and improving the performance. Proxy servers also use cache to store frequently accessed content locally, reducing the load on the upstream server and improving the response time for subsequent requests.  This is particularly useful in corporate networks where multiple users access the same content, such as internal web pages, and email attachments.",1,191,1075,6,97,0.5078534031413613,0.2931937172774869,4.727748691099476,31.833333333333332,31.76843137254903,15.867058823529415,18.15686274509804,16.11434528070225,13.247058823529418,0.36649214659685864,0.27835051546391754,0.1134020618556701,0.08247422680412371,0.061855670103092786,0.10824742268041238,0.041237113402061855,0,0.0,13,0,0,0,0,0.06806282722513089,0,0

"The standard for serial transmission is a set of rules and guidelines that specify how data is transmitted over a serial communication channel.  These standards define the physical and electrical characteristics of the communication channel, as well as the format and timing of the data that is transmitted. The most common serial transmission standard is RS-232, which is a standard developed by the Electronic Industries Association (EIA) for serial communication between devices.  RS-232 defines the electrical signal levels, timing, and data format for serial communication, including the use of start and stop bits, parity bits, and other control characters. Other serial transmission standards include RS-422, RS-485, and Universal Serial Bus (USB), each with its own set of specifications for electrical characteristics, signaling, and data format.  These standards are used in different applications and industries, depending on the specific requirements for data transmission. In general, serial transmission involves transmitting data one bit at a time over a single communication channel, with each bit representing a binary value of 0 or 1.  The data is transmitted in a specific format, with each transmission including a start bit, data bits, optional parity bit, and stop bit, which enables the receiving device to synchronize and correctly interpret the data being transmitted.

"A number of applications programs include the ability for third-party developers to write small programs that extend the main program’s functionality.  For example, thousands of “filters” (algorithms for transforming images) have been written for Adobe Photoshop.  These small programs are called plug-ins because they are designed to connect to the main program and provide their service whenever it is desired or required. Perhaps the most commonly encountered plug-ins are those available for Web browsers such as Firefox, Netscape, or Internet Explorer.  Plug-ins can enable the browser to display new types of files (such as multimedia).  Many standard programs for particular kinds of files are now provided both as stand-alone applications and as browser plug-ins.  Examples include Adobe (PDF document format), Apple QuickTime (graphics, video, and animation), RealPlayer (streaming video and audio), and Macromedia Flash (interactive animation and presentation).  These and many other plug-ins are offered free for the downloading, in order to increase the number of potential users for the formats and thus the market for the development packages. One of the most useful plug-ins found in most browsers is one that allows the browser to run Java applets ,.  In turn, Java is often used to write other plug-ins.

"Dot matrix printers are a type of impact printer that use a matrix of pins to print text and graphics on paper.  They were widely used in the 1980s and 1990s for printing documents, receipts, and other materials. Unlike modern inkjet and laser printers, which use a non-impact printing process, dot matrix printers work by striking a ribbon against paper to create dots that form characters and images.  The print quality of dot matrix printers is generally lower than other types of printers, but they have the advantage of being able to print on multi-part forms and other thick media. Dot matrix printers were popular in many industries because of their durability and reliability, as well as their ability to print carbon copies and other multipart forms.  They were commonly used in point-of-sale systems, inventory control systems, and other business applications. Today, dot matrix printers are less common, as they have largely been replaced by faster, more efficient printers with higher print quality.

"Multitasking refers to the ability of an individual or a system to perform multiple tasks simultaneously.  In a computing context, multitasking refers to the ability of an operating system to run multiple programs or processes at the same time, allowing the user to switch between them or have multiple programs running in the background. For humans, multitasking can refer to the ability to perform multiple tasks or activities at the same time, such as typing an email while listening to music, or cooking dinner while talking on the phone.  However, research has shown that human multitasking is often not as effective as performing each task separately and in sequence, as multitasking can lead to decreased productivity and increased stress.

"In order for a computer to work with information, the information must be digitized—converted to data that application programs can recognize and manipulate ,.  Computer users have thus been confronted with the task of converting millions of pages of printed words or graphics into machine-readable form.  Since it is expensive to re-key text (and impractical to redraw images), some way is needed to automatically convert the varying shades or colors of the text or images into a digitized graphics image that can be stored in a file. This is what a scanner does.  The scanner head contains a charge-coupled device (CCD) like that used in digital cameras ,.  The CCD contains thousands or millions of tiny regions that can convert incoming light into a voltage level.  Each of these voltage levels, when amplified, will correspond to one pixel of the scanned image.

"Neuroprosthetics is the creation of artificial limbs or sensoryorgans that are directly connected to the nervous system. The first (and most widely used) example is the cochlearimplant, which can restore hearing by taking sound signals from a microphone and converting them to electricalimpulses that directly stimulate auditory nerves within thecochlea, a part of the inner ear.  Similarly, experimental retinal implants that stimulate optic nerves are beginning tooffer crude but useful vision to certain blind patients. Research in connecting the brain to artificial arms orlegs is still in its early stages, but scientists using microelectrode arrays have been able to record signals from thebrain’s neurons and correlate them to different types ofmotor movements.  In a series of experiments at Duke University, researchers first trained a monkey to operate a joystick to move a shape in a video game.  They then recordedand analyzed the signals produced by the monkey’s brainwhile playing the game, and correlated them with themotor movements in the joystick.  Next, they replicatedthese movements with a robotic arm as the monkey movedthe joystick.  Finally, they were able to train the monkey tomove the robotic arm without using the joystick at all, simply by “thinking” about the movements.",0,222,1300,8,131,0.5900900900900901,0.4369369369369369,4.95045045045045,27.75,35.83047271573605,14.379232233502538,16.75355329949239,15.414825405933506,14.677157360406092,0.3738738738738739,0.24888888888888888,0.10222222222222223,0.09777777777777778,0.057777777777777775,0.1111111111111111,0.04,4,0.018018018018018018,9,0,0,0,0,0.04054054054054054,0,0

"Digital Signature uses public-key algorithm to generate a digital signature,which is a block of data used to create some authentication ,.  When a judge sees a digital signature, he or she does not knowanything about the signatory’s intentions.

The problemis that:while a digital signature authenticates the document up to the point of the signingcomputer,it does not authenticate the link between that computer and the individual. Digital signatures prove, mathematically, that a secret value known as theprivate key was present in a computer at the time the person’s signature wascalculated.  It is a small step from that inferring that the individual enteredthat key into the computer at the time of signing.

"The earliest form of voting system consisted of paper ballots marked and tabulated entirely by hand.  The first generation of “automatic” voting systems involved mechanical voting machines (where votes were registered by pulling levers).  Next came two types of hybrid systems where votes were cast mechanically but tabulated automatically.  These systems used punch cards , or “marksense” or similar systems where the voter filled in little squares and the ballots were then scanned and tabulated automatically. The ultraclose and highly disputed 2000 U. S.  presidential election “stress-tested” voting systems that most people had previously believed were reasonably accurate.  The principal problems were the interpretation of punch cards that were not properly punched through (so-called dimpled or hanging chads) and the fact that some ballot layouts proved to be confusing or ambiguous.

"A hard drive is a non-volatile storage device used to store digital data, such as computer files and software applications.  It consists of one or more platters, which are circular disks coated with a magnetic material that can store data, and a set of read/write heads that can read and write data to the platters. When data is written to a hard drive, the read/write heads magnetically encode the data onto the platters.  To read the data, the read/write heads move over the platters and sense the magnetic fields to retrieve the encoded data.  Hard drives typically spin at high speeds, often between 5400 and 7200 revolutions per minute (RPM), to enable faster data access. Hard drives come in different form factors, such as 2. 5-inch and 3. 5-inch drives, and in different capacities, ranging from a few hundred gigabytes to several terabytes.  They can be connected to a computer via various interfaces, such as SATA, SCSI, or IDE, and can be internal or external. In addition to traditional hard drives, there are also solid-state drives (SSDs) that use flash memory to store data.  Unlike hard drives, SSDs have no moving parts, which makes them faster and more durable than hard drives.  However, they are generally more expensive and have lower storage capacities than hard drives. Hard drives are a common type of storage device used in personal computers, servers, and other computing devices.

"While VoIP (Voice over Internet Protocol) technology has many benefits, there are also some disadvantages that users should be aware of.  Here are some of the main disadvantages of VoIP:Dependence on the Internet: VoIP calls require a reliable and high-speed internet connection to work effectively.  If the internet connection is slow or unreliable, the call quality may suffer, or the call may drop altogether. Power Outages: Unlike traditional phone systems that can continue to work during a power outage, VoIP phones require electricity to function.  If the power goes out, VoIP phones may not work, unless they are equipped with a backup power supply. Emergency Calling: VoIP services may not be as reliable as traditional phone systems when it comes to emergency calling.  In some cases, emergency services may not be able to identify the caller's location accurately, which could delay response times. Compatibility Issues: Some VoIP services may not be compatible with certain devices or operating systems.  Users may need to install additional software or hardware to use VoIP services effectively. Security: VoIP calls are susceptible to security breaches, such as eavesdropping, hacking, and identity theft.  Users should take appropriate security measures, such as using strong passwords and encryption, to protect their calls and data. Quality of Service: VoIP call quality can be affected by various factors, such as network congestion, bandwidth limitations, and packet loss.  The quality of service may vary depending on the internet connection and other factors, which could affect the user experience.

"many programs and operating systems are structured as an endless  loop  where  an  input  (or  command)  is  processed, the  results  returned,  the  next  input  is  processed,  and  so on, until an exit command is received.  A mode or state can be  used  to  determine  the  system’s  activity.   For  example,  a program  might  be  in  different  modes  such  as  waiting  for input,  processing  input,  displaying  results,  and  so  on.   The program  logic  will  refer  to  the  current  state  to  determine what  to  do  next  and  at  some  point  the  logic  will transitionthe system to the next state in the sequence.  The validity of some kinds of programs, protocols, or circuits can therefore be proven by showing that there is an equivalent finite-state machine—and thus that all possible combinations of inputs have been accounted for.

"A touchscreen is an input device that allows a user to interact with a computer or other electronic device by touching the screen with their finger or a stylus.  Touchscreens can be found in a wide range of devices, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, interactive kiosks, and even some car dashboards. There are several types of touchscreens, including:Resistive touchscreens: These touchscreens work by applying pressure to the surface of the screen, which triggers a response.  They are typically made up of multiple layers, including a flexible top layer and a rigid bottom layer, with a gap between them that contains conductive material.  When pressure is applied to the top layer, it comes into contact with the conductive material, which triggers a response. Capacitive touchscreens: These touchscreens work by detecting changes in electrical charges on the screen.  They are typically made up of a single layer of conductive material, such as indium tin oxide, which is coated onto a glass surface.  When a user touches the screen, their finger or stylus changes the electrical charge at that point, which is detected by the screen's sensors and triggers a response. Infrared touchscreens: These touchscreens use infrared sensors to detect the position of a user's finger or stylus on the screen.  The screen emits a grid of infrared beams across the surface, and when a user touches the screen, their finger or stylus interrupts the beams, which is detected by the sensors and triggers a response. Surface acoustic wave touchscreens: These touchscreens use ultrasonic waves to detect the position of a user's finger or stylus on the screen.  The screen emits ultrasonic waves across the surface, and when a user touches the screen, their finger or stylus absorbs some of the waves, which is detected by the screen's sensors and triggers a response. Touchscreens are becoming increasingly popular due to their ease of use and intuitive interface, and are expected to continue to be a key input device for a wide range of devices in the future.",1,378,2056,13,130,0.3439153439153439,0.18253968253968253,4.542328042328043,29.076923076923077,45.67862785862786,13.251651651651652,15.411319011319012,13.639024540459548,12.183783783783788,0.4021164021164021,0.2649350649350649,0.1012987012987013,0.08571428571428572,0.01038961038961039,0.10909090909090909,0.033766233766233764,2,0.005291005291005291,22,0,5,0,0,0.0582010582010582,0,0
"There are several different sound file formats, each with its own advantages and disadvantages depending on the intended use case.  Here are some of the most common sound file formats:WAV (Waveform Audio File Format): This is a standard uncompressed audio format that is commonly used for storing high-quality audio.  It has good sound quality but large file sizes. MP3 (MPEG Audio Layer III): This is a compressed audio format that has become popular for music downloads and streaming.  It is able to reduce file sizes significantly while still maintaining good sound quality. AAC (Advanced Audio Coding): This is another compressed audio format that is commonly used for music downloads and streaming.  It is similar to MP3 but provides better sound quality at lower bit rates. FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec): This is a compressed audio format that is designed to provide lossless compression, meaning that the sound quality is not degraded in the compression process.  It is commonly used for storing high-quality audio files. OGG (Ogg Vorbis): This is an open-source compressed audio format that is similar to MP3 but provides better sound quality at lower bit rates.  It is commonly used for music downloads and streaming. AIFF (Audio Interchange File Format): This is an uncompressed audio format that is commonly used on Apple computers.  It provides high-quality sound but has larger file sizes than some other formats.

"A data structure is a way of organizing data for use in a computer program.  There are three basic components to a data structure: a set of suitable basic data types, a way to organize or relate these data items to one another, and a set of operations, or ways to manipulate the data. For example, the array is a data structure that can consist of just about any of the basic data types, although all data must be of the same type.  The way the data is organized is by storing it in sequentially addressable locations.

"SAP has recognized for some time that while its base of large Fortune 500 companies has given it steady income, changing trends in business have been limiting the software giant’s growth.  In particular, the trend has been toward smaller, simpler, more scalable applications that can be integrated with modern Web services.  In September 2007 SAP announced SAP Business ByDesign, a flexible set of enterprise management services that are delivered over the Web.  However, it remains to be seen how well SAP will be able to compete with more agile companies such as NetSuite and Salesforce. com, and whether the company will be able to upgrade its existing large company user base without disaffecting it. SAP’s major competitor in the United States is Oracle ,, which has sued SAP in 2007 for unfairly downloading and using patches and support materials from Oracle and using them to support former Oracle customers.  SAP and Oracle have generally had quite different growth strategies: SAP grows by expanding and extending its own products, while Oracle has grown mainly through acquiring other companies.  However, in October 2007 SAP acquired Business Objects, a leader in “business intelligence” systems, for $6. 8 billion.

The growth of the language coincided with the development of more powerful desktop computers and the release of inexpensive, easy-to-use but powerful development environments from Microsoft, Borland, and others.  Since these compilers could also handle traditional C code, programmers could “port” existing code and use the object-oriented techniques of C++ as they mastered them.

"In computer science, a checksum is a value calculated from a set of data, typically a file or a message, used to detect errors that may have occurred during transmission or storage. The checksum is usually a small fixed-size value that is generated using an algorithm, such as the cyclic redundancy check (CRC) algorithm.  The algorithm takes the data as input and produces a unique checksum value that is different for each set of data. Checksums are commonly used to verify the integrity of data during transmission or storage.  When a file is transmitted over a network or stored on a disk, its checksum is calculated and transmitted or stored alongside the file.  When the file is received or accessed, the checksum is recalculated and compared to the original checksum.  If the two checksums match, it is assumed that the data has not been corrupted or modified during transmission or storage. Checksums can also be used to detect accidental or intentional changes to data.  If even a single bit of the data is changed, the checksum value will be different, indicating that an error has occurred.  Checksums can be used to detect errors in a wide range of applications, including network protocols, file systems, and databases.",1,230,1232,10,102,0.4434782608695652,0.2826086956521739,4.439130434782609,23.0,44.65221359223304,12.148854368932039,14.259417475728156,13.506818969022046,10.805825242718445,0.4217391304347826,0.226890756302521,0.13445378151260504,0.046218487394957986,0.02100840336134454,0.07983193277310924,0.09243697478991597,8,0.034782608695652174,12,0,0,0,0,0.05217391304347826,0,2
"The earliest computer chess theorists such as Claude Shannon and Alan Turing saw the game as one potential way to demonstrate true machine intelligence.  Ironically, by the time computers had truly mastered chess, the artificial intelligence (AI) community had concluded that mastering the game was largely irrelevant to their goals.  AI pioneers Herbert Simon and John McCarthy have referred to chess as “the Drosophila of AI. ” By this they mean that, like the ubiquitous fruit flies in genetics research, chess became an easy way to measure computer prowess.  But what was it measuring? The dominant brute-force approach was more a measure of computing power than the application of such AI techniques as pattern recognition.  (There is, however, still some interest in writing chess programs that “think” more like a human player. ) In recent years there has been some interest in programming computers to play the Asian board game Go, where positional and structural elements play a greater role than in chess.

"VoIP stands for Voice over Internet Protocol, which is a technology that allows users to make voice calls over the internet rather than traditional phone lines.  Instead of using a dedicated circuit-switched network, VoIP converts analog audio signals into digital data packets that can be transmitted over the internet. VoIP technology has several advantages over traditional telephone systems.  First, it is typically much cheaper than traditional phone systems, especially for long-distance and international calls.  Second, it allows users to make calls from anywhere with an internet connection, which is especially useful for remote workers and businesses with multiple locations.  Third, it offers a range of features and services such as call forwarding, voicemail, and conference calling, which are often included at no extra cost. There are several ways to use VoIP technology.  One way is to use a software-based service such as Skype, which allows users to make free voice and video calls over the internet.  Another way is to use a dedicated VoIP phone, which looks and works like a traditional phone but uses the internet instead of phone lines to make calls.  Finally, many businesses use VoIP phone systems, which are designed specifically for businesses and can support a large number of users and advanced features such as call routing, auto-attendant, and integration with other business applications.

"A stack is simply a list that represents successive locations in memory into which data can be inserted.  The operation of a stack can be visualized as being rather like the springloaded platform onto which dishes are stacked for washing in some restaurants.  As each dish (number) is added, the stack is “pushed. ” Because only the item “on top” (the last one added) can be removed (“popped”) at any given time, a stack is described as a LIFO (last in, first out) structure.  (Note that this is different from a queue, where items can be added or removed from either end [see queue]. )Stacks are useful whenever nested items must be tracked.  For example, a procedure might call a procedure that in turn calls another procedure.  The stack can keep track of the parameters (as well as the calling address) for each pending procedure.

"A Digital Certificate, also known as a public key certificate, is an electronic document that is used to verify the authenticity of a digital entity, such as a website, server, or person. Digital certificates work by linking a public key to an identity, such as the name of a website or organization.  The certificate is issued by a trusted third party, called a Certificate Authority (CA), who verifies the identity of the entity and signs the certificate with their own digital signature.  This creates a chain of trust, in which a user can trust the entity's identity because they trust the CA that issued the certificate. When a user connects to a website or server that has a digital certificate, their browser or application checks the certificate to ensure that it is valid and issued by a trusted CA.

"Senior citizens, also known as older adults, have become an increasingly important demographic in the use of computing technologies.  While some seniors may feel intimidated by new technologies or have physical limitations that make it difficult to use computers, many others have embraced computing as a way to stay connected with loved ones, access information, and engage with the world around them. Here are some key aspects of senior citizens and computing:Accessibility: Many seniors have physical limitations that make it difficult to use computers, such as poor eyesight, hearing loss, or mobility issues.  Computer manufacturers and software developers have responded by creating products and features that are more accessible to seniors, such as larger text, audio cues, and touch screens. Social connections: For many seniors, computing has become a way to stay connected with family and friends who live far away.  Social networking platforms such as Facebook, Twitter, and Instagram have made it easier to stay in touch with loved ones and share photos and updates. Health and wellness: Computing technologies can be used to help seniors monitor their health and wellness, such as through fitness trackers, medication reminders, and telemedicine platforms that allow them to consult with doctors remotely. Lifelong learning: The internet provides a wealth of information and educational resources that can be accessed from the comfort of one's home.  Seniors can use computers to continue learning and exploring new topics, whether through online courses, webinars, or research. Entertainment: Computers and mobile devices offer a wide range of entertainment options for seniors, such as streaming movies and TV shows, playing games, and listening to music. In summary, computing technologies have become an important part of many seniors' lives, providing them with new ways to stay connected, informed, and engaged.  By making computing more accessible and user-friendly for seniors, we can help ensure that everyone has the opportunity to benefit from these technologies.",1,363,2087,12,174,0.4793388429752066,0.31955922865013775,4.873278236914601,30.25,29.666279193205952,15.622006369426753,18.746921443736735,16.827784334635936,14.839490445859866,0.3333333333333333,0.27297297297297296,0.12972972972972974,0.10270270270270271,0.021621621621621623,0.0945945945945946,0.043243243243243246,3,0.008264462809917356,28,0,6,0,0,0.07713498622589532,0,6

"Telnet is a network protocol used to establish a remote login session on a computer or other device over a network. Telnet allows a user to log in to a remote computer or device and perform tasks as if they were sitting in front of it.  This is done by establishing a Telnet session between the user's computer and the remote device, and then sending commands and receiving responses through the Telnet protocol. While Telnet was widely used in the early days of computer networking, it is now considered an insecure protocol, as it sends data and credentials in plain text, which can be intercepted and read by attackers.  For this reason, more secure protocols such as SSH (Secure Shell) are often used instead of Telnet for remote login sessions.",1,143,749,5,82,0.5734265734265734,0.3916083916083916,4.321678321678322,28.6,46.38653846153849,13.248461538461541,15.938461538461539,13.968273953766033,10.053846153846155,0.4405594405594406,0.22758620689655173,0.1103448275862069,0.06206896551724138,0.041379310344827586,0.11724137931034483,0.05517241379310345,2,0.013986013986013986,5,0,0,0,0,0.03496503496503497,0,1

"The ever-growing World Wide Web consists of billions of linked HTML documents (and other resources), but most of the links contain no information about why the linkage has been made or what it might mean.  Services such as Google can automatically trace the links and index each page , with the aid of “metadata” such as keywords that summarize page content.  However, discovering the relationships between data items on pages, or between pages—and their meaning, or semantics—requires human scrutiny. In his 1999 book Weaving the Web, World Wide Web creator Tim Berners-Lee , described a new way in which Web pages might be organized in the future:I have a dream for the Web [in which computers] become capable of analyzing all the data on the Web—the content, links, and transactions between people and computers.  A “Semantic Web,” which should make this possible, has yet to emerge, but when it does, the day-to-day mechanisms of trade, bureaucracy and our daily lives will be handled by machines talking to machines.  The “intelligent agents” people have touted for ages will finally materialize. In other words, by encoding definitions of objects and their relationships into the text of Web pages, programs , can be written to use this information to answer sophisticated questions such as “which devices from this vendor use open-source software?”",0,254,1355,7,145,0.5708661417322834,0.4015748031496063,4.460629921259843,36.285714285714285,37.25666666666669,15.728544973544977,18.26878306878307,15.903189008614273,12.455555555555556,0.4015748031496063,0.23722627737226276,0.10583941605839416,0.05474452554744526,0.01824817518248175,0.11313868613138686,0.051094890510948905,7,0.027559055118110236,17,0,1,0,1,0.07086614173228346,1,1

"A  class  is  a  data  type  that  combines  both  a  data  structure and  methods  for  manipulating  the  data.   For  example,  a string  class  might  consist  of  an  array  to  hold  the  charac-ters in the string and methods to compare strings, combine strings,  or  extract  portions  of  a  string  ,. As  with  other  data  types,  once  a  class  is  declared, objects  (sometimes  called  instances)  of  the  class  can  be created  and  used.   This  way  of  structuring  programs  is called   object-oriented   programming   because   the   class object  is  the  basic  building  block  ,. Object-oriented  programming  and  classes  provide  sev-eral advantages over traditional block-structured languages.  In  a  traditional  BASIC  or  even  Pascal  program,  there  is no  particular  connection  between  the  data  structure  and the  procedures  or  functions  that  manipulate  it.   In  a  large program  one  programmer  might  change  the  data  structure without  alerting  other  programmers  whose  code  assumes the  original  structure.   On  the  other  hand,  someone  might write  a  procedure  that  directly  manipulates  the  internal data rather than using the methods already provided.  Either transgression can lead to hard-to-find bugs. With  a  class,  however,  data  and  procedures  are  bound together,  or  encapsulated.   This  means  that  the  data  in  a class  object  can  be  manipulated  only  by  using  one  of  the methods  provided  by  the  class.   If  the  person  in  charge of  maintaining  the  class  decides  to  provide  an  improved implementation  of  the  data  structure,  as  long  as  the  data parameters  expected  by  the  class  methods  do  not  change, code  that  uses  the  class  objects  will  continue  to  function properly.",0,281,1813,12,135,0.4804270462633452,0.3309608540925267,4.790035587188612,23.416666666666668,43.320792160737824,12.454634387351781,14.599341238471673,13.81666964889586,12.850592885375494,0.38434163701067614,0.158953722334004,0.08651911468812877,0.026156941649899398,0.02012072434607646,0.05432595573440644,0.03219315895372234,3,0.010676156583629894,14,0,0,0,0,0.0498220640569395,1,3
"Neuroprosthetics is a field of study that involves developing devices that can replace or restore the function of the nervous system.  These devices are designed to interface directly with the brain, spinal cord, or peripheral nerves and can be used to restore movement, sensation, or other functions that may have been lost due to injury or disease. At Duke University, researchers have been working on developing advanced neuroprosthetics that can help people with spinal cord injuries regain movement and mobility.  One of the key areas of focus has been on developing brain-machine interfaces (BMIs) that can translate brain activity into movement. In a recent study published in the journal Nature Medicine, researchers at Duke University demonstrated that a monkey with a spinal cord injury was able to regain the ability to walk with the help of a brain-controlled robotic exoskeleton.  The monkey had electrodes implanted in its brain that were able to decode signals related to movement and translate them into commands that controlled the robotic exoskeleton. The researchers also used a wireless connection to send feedback from the exoskeleton back to the monkey's brain, which allowed it to adjust its movements in real-time.  This approach has the potential to enable people with spinal cord injuries to regain movement and independence. Overall, the research carried out at Duke University and other institutions in the field of neuroprosthetics is aimed at developing new and innovative approaches to restoring function and improving the quality of life for people with neurological disorders or injuries.",1,271,1621,9,132,0.4870848708487085,0.3173431734317343,5.044280442804428,30.11111111111111,25.8433156263834,16.583081009296148,19.761133244798586,17.251386760058843,14.195219123505975,0.4095940959409594,0.24555160142348753,0.13523131672597866,0.06761565836298933,0.014234875444839857,0.12099644128113879,0.060498220640569395,7,0.025830258302583026,8,0,0,0,0,0.02952029520295203,0,1

"Image  processing  is  a  general  term  for  the  manipulation of  a  digitized  image  to  produce  an  enhanced  or  more  con-venient  version.   Some  of  the  earliest  applications  were  in the military (aerial and, later, satellite reconnaissance) and in  the  space  program.   The  military  and  space  programs had a great need for extracting as much useful information as  possible  from  images  that  were  often  gathered  under extreme or marginal conditions.  They also needed to make cameras  and  other  hardware  components  simultaneously more  compact  and  more  efficient,  and  generally  had  the funds to pay for such specialized developments. Once  developed,  higher-quality  image  processing  sys-tems found their way into other applications such as domes-tic  surveillance  and  medical  imaging.   The  development  of cameras that could directly turn light into digitized images , made image processing seam-less by avoiding the necessity of scanning images from tra-ditional film.

"Just as the way business is organized and conducted has been profoundly changed by information and communications technology, the operation of government at all levels has been similarly affected.  The term e-government (or electronic government) is a way of looking at these changes as a whole and of considering how government uses (or might use) various computer applications. The use of information technology in government can involve changes in the organization and internal communications of government departments, changes in how services are delivered to the public, and providing new ways for the public to interact with the agency. Internally, government agencies have many of the same information management and sharing needs as private enterprises ,.  However, government agencies are likely to have to adapt their information systems to account for complex, specialized regulations (both those the agency administers and others it is subject to).  The standards of openness and accountability are generally different from and stricter than those that apply to private organizations.",0,181,1096,6,100,0.5524861878453039,0.3756906077348066,5.143646408839779,30.166666666666668,15.974444444444458,17.738765432098763,20.92345679012346,19.6203779977781,15.719753086419754,0.425414364640884,0.2849462365591398,0.0913978494623656,0.07526881720430108,0.03225806451612903,0.11827956989247312,0.06451612903225806,0,0.0,7,0,0,0,0,0.03867403314917127,1,2
"Neurality refers to the concept of neural networks, which are a type of artificial intelligence modeled after the structure and function of the human brain. Neural networks are composed of interconnected nodes, called artificial neurons, that process and transmit information.  Each neuron receives input from multiple other neurons and computes a weighted sum of these inputs.  The neuron then passes this sum through a nonlinear activation function to produce an output, which is then transmitted to other neurons.  This process of computing weighted sums and passing the results through activation functions is repeated multiple times, allowing the neural network to build increasingly complex representations of the input data. Neural networks can be trained to perform a wide range of tasks, such as image recognition, language translation, and even playing games like chess.  The training process involves adjusting the weights on the connections between neurons so as to minimize a chosen loss function.  This process is repeated for multiple passes over the training data, until the network has learned to accurately predict the desired output for a given input.",1,195,1170,8,107,0.5487179487179488,0.37435897435897436,5.066666666666666,24.375,36.914171348314625,13.638061797752808,14.742696629213484,13.427899808715576,14.508988764044947,0.37948717948717947,0.285,0.145,0.085,0.025,0.105,0.04,0,0.0,9,0,0,0,0,0.046153846153846156,0,2
"Telnet  is  another  fundamental  service  that  brought the  Internet  much  of  its  early  utility.   Telnet  allows  a user at one computer to log into another machine and run a program there.

"UNIX is a multi-user, multi-tasking operating system that was developed in the late 1960s and early 1970s at Bell Labs.  The architecture of UNIX can be divided into several layers, each providing different services to the user and to the system. Kernel: The kernel is the core of the operating system, responsible for managing system resources such as memory, CPU time, and input/output devices.  It also provides an interface between applications and the hardware. Shell: The shell is a command-line interface that allows users to interact with the operating system.  It interprets user commands and passes them to the kernel for execution.  There are several types of shells available in UNIX, including the Bourne shell (sh), C shell (csh), Korn shell (ksh), and Bash shell (bash). File system: The file system is responsible for managing files and directories on the storage devices.  UNIX file systems are organized as a hierarchical tree structure, with the root directory (/) at the top and subdirectories branching out from there. Utilities: UNIX provides a set of command-line utilities for managing the operating system and performing various tasks, such as copying files, searching for text in files, and manipulating text files.  These utilities include ls, cp, grep, and sed, among many others. Libraries: UNIX provides a set of standard libraries that can be used by application developers to simplify their coding efforts.  These libraries include the Standard C Library (libc) and the POSIX (Portable Operating System Interface) library. Applications: UNIX supports a wide range of applications, including text editors, compilers, web servers, and database management systems.  Some of the most popular UNIX applications include the vi editor, the gcc compiler, the Apache web server, and the MySQL database management system. Overall, the architecture of UNIX is designed to provide a flexible, modular, and extensible operating system that can be customized to meet the needs of individual users and organizations.",1,377,2033,16,164,0.4350132625994695,0.2864721485411141,4.541114058355437,23.5625,32.91516473642173,13.528192891373802,17.409664536741214,15.742502247213078,13.13226837060703,0.3129973474801061,0.28607594936708863,0.08607594936708861,0.05822784810126582,0.010126582278481013,0.08607594936708861,0.03291139240506329,17,0.04509283819628647,27,0,6,0,0,0.07161803713527852,0,0

"When modern digital computing emerged in the 1940s, it evolved from two roots: engineering (particularly electrical engineering) and mathematics.  The goals of the earliest computer designers were focused naturally enough on computing, although several early thinkers , had already begun to think of computers as symbol-processing and knowledgeretrieving machines, not just number crunchers. As computer scientists began to become more concerned about the structure of data and the modeling of real-world objects in computer languages ,, they began to wrestle with some areas long familiar to philosophers.  As data structure involved into knowledge representations, epistemology (the philosophical investigation of the meaning and accessibility of knowledge) became more relevant, particularly in developing systems for artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Also relevant is ontology (the nature and relationship of entities—see ontologies and data models), particularly with regard to the modern effort to encode relationships between items of knowledge into Web pages ,",0,168,1081,5,105,0.625,0.4880952380952381,5.529761904761905,33.6,-1.4141632653060867,20.760353741496598,22.916462585034015,19.686211704642208,18.900680272108847,0.3333333333333333,0.3163841807909605,0.07909604519774012,0.07909604519774012,0.062146892655367235,0.12994350282485875,0.01694915254237288,2,0.011904761904761904,10,0,1,0,0,0.05952380952380952,0,7

"A  number  of  handheld  computers  beginning  with  Apple’s Newton in the mid-1990s and the now popular Palm devices and  BlackBerry  have  some  ability  to  recognize  handwrit-ing.   However,  current  systems  can  be  frustrating  to  use 0        handwriting recognitionbecause accuracy often requires that users write very care-fully  and  consistently  or  (as  in  the  case  of  the  Palm)  even replace their usual letter strokes with simplified alternatives that the computer can more easily recognize.  If the user is allowed  to  use  normal  strokes,  the  system  must  be  gradu-ally  “trained”  by  the  user  giving  writing  samples  and  con-firming the system’s guess about the letters.  As the software becomes  more  adaptable  and  processing  power  increases (allowing  more  sophisticated  algorithms  or  larger  neural networks  to  be  practical)  users  will  be  able  to  write  more naturally and systems will gain more consumer acceptance.

"A dynamic link library (DLL) is a collection of small programs that larger programs can load when needed to complete specific tasks.  The small program, called a DLL file, contains instructions that help the larger program handle what may not be a core function of the original program. An example of those tasks might be communicating with a specific device, such as a printer or scanner to process a document.  DLL files that support specific device operations are known as device drivers. DLL contains bits of code and data, like classes and variables, or other resources such as images that the larger program can use. In addition to being a generic term for dynamic link libraries, Dynamic Link Library is also the name of Microsoft's version of the shared library concept for Windows.

"The alternative is to connect the remote participant to a mobile robot (this is sometimes called telerobotics).  Such robots already exist, although their capabilities are limited and they are not yet widely used for meetings.  RodneyBrooks, director of the MIT Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, foresees a not very distant future in which such robots will be commonplace. The robot will have considerable built-in capabilities, so the person who has “roboted in” to it won’t need to worry about the mechanics of walking, avoiding obstacles, or focusing vision on particular objects.  Seeing and acting through the robot, the person will be able to move around an environment as freely as persons who are physically present.  The operator can give general commands amounting to “walk over there” or “pick up this object” or perform more delicate manipulations by using his or her hands to manipulate gloves connected to a force-feedback mechanism. Brooks sees numerous applications for robotic telepresence.  For example, someone at work could “robot in” to his or her household robot and do things such as checking to make sure appliances are on or off, respond to a burglar alarm, or even refill the cat’s food dish.  Robotic telepresence could also be used to bring expertise (such as that of a surgeon) to any site around the world without the time and expense of physical travel.

"Blockchain technology is a decentralized digital system that securely records and verifies transactions across a network of computers. Instead of relying on a single central authority, blockchain distributes information across many participants, making it transparent, tamper-resistant, and highly secure.

"Cyberpunk is a subgenre of science fiction that typically focuses on a future dystopian society dominated by advanced technology and corporate control.  The term was first used in the 1980s to describe a type of science fiction that features a gritty, urban setting, high-tech weaponry, and a distinct anti-authoritarian attitude. The central themes of cyberpunk often include a focus on the dangers of technology and the impact of artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and cybernetic enhancements on human society.  It often explores themes of social decay, economic inequality, and the struggle of individuals to find their place in a complex and oppressive world. Some well-known examples of cyberpunk include William Gibson's Neuromancer, Bruce Sterling's Schismatrix, and the movies Blade Runner and The Matrix.  Cyberpunk has also influenced other media, such as video games, music, and fashion.",1,155,905,6,95,0.6129032258064516,0.49032258064516127,4.95483870967742,25.833333333333332,22.94416666666669,15.648703703703706,18.185185185185187,16.11434528070225,14.89185185185185,0.32903225806451614,0.2621951219512195,0.06707317073170732,0.13414634146341464,0.036585365853658534,0.09146341463414634,0.018292682926829267,6,0.03870967741935484,12,0,0,0,0,0.07741935483870968,0,4

"Programmers and managers of software development are generally aware of the need for software to properly deal with erroneous data ,.  They know that any significant program will have bugs that must be rooted out ,.  Good software engineering practices and a systematic approach to assuring the reliability and quality of software can minimize problems in the finished product ,.  However, serious bugs are not always caught, and sometimes the consequences can be catastrophic.  For example, in the Therac 25 computerized X-ray cancer treatment machine, poorly thought-out command entry routines plus a counter overflow resulted in three patients being killed by massive X-ray overdoses.

Pattern recognition is at theheart of many areas of research and application in computing ,. Despite the challenge in getting machines to do what comes naturally for biological organisms, the potentialpayoffs are immense. A pattern-recognition system begins with data, whetherstored or real-time (such as from a robot’s camera).  The firsttask in turning potentially billions of bytes of data intomeaningful objects is to extract features from what is likelya high proportion of redundant or irrelevant data.  (Withvisual images, this often involves finding edges that defineshapes. ) The extracted features are then classified to determine what objects they might represent.  This can be doneby comparing structures to templates or previously classified data or by applying statistical analysis to determine thelikely correlation of the new data to existing patterns ,.

"The CPU cache is a small and fast memory storage area located on the processor chip that is used to store frequently used data and instructions.  Its purpose is to speed up the processing time of the CPU by reducing the number of times it needs to access the slower main memory or RAM. When a program requests data or instructions from the main memory, the CPU first checks if the requested data or instruction is present in the cache.  If it is, the CPU retrieves the data from the cache instead of going to the main memory.  This process is much faster because the cache is located on the processor chip and has a much shorter access time than the main memory.",1,130,662,5,64,0.49230769230769234,0.2923076923076923,4.130769230769231,26.0,60.124536585365874,10.98448780487805,15.368455284552846,13.662883650711645,7.9886178861788615,0.4461538461538462,0.2706766917293233,0.10526315789473684,0.08270676691729323,0.03007518796992481,0.09022556390977443,0.05263157894736842,6,0.046153846153846156,2,0,0,0,0,0.015384615384615385,0,0

"The process of removing redundant information from data so that it takes up less space is called data compression.  Besides saving disk space, compressing data such as e-mail attachments can make data communications faster. Compression methods generally begin with the realization that not all characters are found in equal numbers in text.  For example, in English, letters such as e and s are found much more frequently than letters such as j or x.

"Port Address Translation (PAT), also known as Network Address Port Translation (NAPT), is a technique used in computer networking to allow multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address. PAT works by assigning a unique port number to each device on the private network, which allows the router to keep track of which device is associated with each incoming or outgoing connection.  When a device on the private network initiates a connection to the internet, the router replaces the private IP address of the device with the public IP address of the router, and uses the unique port number to identify the device. PAT is commonly used in small office or home networks, where a limited number of public IP addresses are available, and multiple devices need to access the internet simultaneously.  It's also used by internet service providers (ISPs) to conserve public IP addresses and manage network traffic. Overall, PAT is a useful technique for managing network resources and allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address.",1,196,1067,6,84,0.42857142857142855,0.22959183673469388,4.545918367346939,32.666666666666664,32.20226190476194,16.013571428571428,19.209523809523812,16.52667757954773,12.019428571428573,0.32142857142857145,0.24242424242424243,0.11616161616161616,0.1111111111111111,0.025252525252525252,0.08585858585858586,0.030303030303030304,11,0.05612244897959184,8,0,0,0,0,0.04081632653061224,0,1

"Computer-related businesses must also deal with the effects of  globalization  on  the  market  for  hardware,  software,  and services.

However,  it  becomes  more  difficult  to  extract  a  premium for a brand as opposed to a generic name.

"The semantic Web is not something that can appear overnight—after all, it will take considerable human effort to encode the information needed for machines to understand Web resources, and additional effort to code the application programs that will take advantage of that information.  However, the potential payoff is huge, allowing both human and automated searchers to tackle much more sophisticated tasks. For example, the University of Maryland is developing a prototype semantic search engine called Swoogle.  It can extract information and determine relationships between documents that include RDF or OWL elements.  Swoogle can also help users find appropriate ontologies for exploring a subject ,.

"The Semantic Web is an extension of the World Wide Web that aims to make web content more machine-readable and interconnected.  It is based on the idea of adding metadata, or data that describes other data, to web pages and other online resources. The Semantic Web is designed to enable machines to understand the meaning and context of web content, rather than just presenting it as a collection of text and images.  This can enable new types of applications and services that rely on machine-readable data, such as intelligent search engines, personalized recommendations, and automated decision-making systems. To achieve these goals, the Semantic Web uses a set of standardized technologies and protocols, including:Resource Description Framework (RDF): RDF is a language for describing resources on the web, including people, organizations, and concepts.  It allows metadata to be added to web pages in a structured and machine-readable way. Web Ontology Language (OWL): OWL is a language for creating ontologies, or formal representations of knowledge and concepts.  It allows web content to be classified and organized in a way that machines can understand. SPARQL Protocol and RDF Query Language (SPARQL): SPARQL is a language for querying and manipulating RDF data.  It allows machines to extract information from the Semantic Web and use it in applications and services. The Semantic Web has the potential to revolutionize the way we access and use information on the web.  By making web content more machine-readable and interconnected, it can enable new types of intelligent applications and services that can help us to find and use information more efficiently and effectively.  However, the full potential of the Semantic Web has yet to be realized, and there are still many technical and practical challenges that need to be addressed.",1,329,1851,13,135,0.41033434650455924,0.2553191489361702,4.72644376899696,25.307692307692307,35.9968302387268,13.780344827586205,17.47480106100796,16.001076179640435,13.113103448275861,0.3768996960486322,0.2303206997084548,0.13702623906705538,0.061224489795918366,0.023323615160349854,0.07580174927113703,0.04081632653061224,9,0.02735562310030395,15,0,4,0,0,0.04559270516717325,1,2
"Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is a language used for describing the visual presentation of a web page, including its layout, colors, fonts, and other design elements.  CSS is used in conjunction with HTML and JavaScript to create dynamic and visually appealing web pages. CSS works by defining styles for HTML elements, such as headings, paragraphs, and links, using selectors and properties.  Selectors are used to target specific HTML elements, while properties define the visual appearance of those elements.

"Although they use different devices and formats, text messaging on cell phones and PDAs and instant messaging through online services have much in common.  Both involve sending short messages to other users who can receive them and reply as soon as they are online.  (This is an ad hoc connection that differs from a chat room [see chat, online] in that the latter is an established location where people go to converse with other members.  It also differs from an online discussion group [see conferencing systems and netnews and newsgroups] where messages are posted and may be replied to later, but there is no real-time communication. )Text messaging or texting uses a protocol called Short Message Service (SMS), which is available with most cell phones and service plans as well as PDAs that have wireless connections.  When a user sends a message to a designated recipient, it goes to a service center where it is routed to the destination phone; if that phone is not connected, the message is stored and retried later.  Typically messages are limited to 160 characters, though up to six or so messages can be concatenated and treated as a longer message. While texting did not become popular until the late 1990s, instant messaging began in the 1970s as a way for multiple users on a shared computer or network (such as a UNIX system) to communicate in real time using commands such as send and talk (the latter being more conversational—see chat, online).  In the late 1980s and early 1990s, various dial-up services , provided for sending text messages (AOL was the first to use the term instant messages for its facility).  By the mid-1990s instant messaging was well established on the Internet, often employing a graphical user interface, as with ICQ and AOL Instant Messenger (AOL later acquired ICQ as well).",0,346,1823,10,175,0.5057803468208093,0.33236994219653176,4.364161849710983,34.6,40.85835294117649,15.162300653594773,18.7759477124183,16.03029750255766,11.019607843137255,0.3872832369942196,0.2116991643454039,0.12534818941504178,0.08356545961002786,0.04735376044568245,0.08635097493036212,0.05013927576601671,16,0.046242774566473986,13,1,0,0,0,0.04046242774566474,0,5
"Personal digital assistant (PDA) devices originated from the convergence of several technologies, including electronic organizers, mobile phones, and handheld computing devices.  The first PDA devices were introduced in the 1990s, and they quickly gained popularity among professionals and consumers for their ability to manage schedules, contacts, and tasks. One of the earliest PDA devices was the Apple Newton, which was released in 1993.  It featured a touchscreen interface and handwriting recognition, allowing users to write notes and messages directly on the device.  However, the Newton was expensive and had limited functionality, and it was eventually discontinued in 1998. Other early PDA devices included the Palm Pilot, which was released in 1996 and quickly became a popular choice for its simple interface and compact size.  The Palm Pilot featured a stylus-based interface, allowing users to input text and interact with applications on the device. As technology advanced, PDAs began to incorporate more features, such as mobile phone capabilities, wireless connectivity, and multimedia playback.  This led to the development of smartphones, which combined the functionality of a PDA with the ability to make calls and access the internet. Today, smartphones have largely replaced standalone PDA devices, but the basic concepts of PDA technology continue to influence the development of mobile devices and other personal technology.",1,242,1449,10,128,0.5289256198347108,0.384297520661157,5.090909090909091,24.2,23.561978873239468,15.26441784037559,19.03643192488263,16.887214914478655,15.48638497652582,0.33884297520661155,0.23107569721115537,0.11553784860557768,0.09561752988047809,0.02390438247011952,0.0796812749003984,0.027888446215139442,13,0.05371900826446281,19,0,0,0,0,0.07851239669421488,1,6

"Cellular automata theory has been applied to a variety of fields that deal with the complex interrelationships of components, including biology (microbe growth and population dynamics in general), ecology (including forestry), and animal behavior, such as the flight of birds.  (The cues that a bird identifies in its neighbors are like the input conditions for a cell in a cellular automaton.  The “output” would be the bird’s flight behavior. )The ability of cellular automatons to generate a rich complexity from simple components and rules mimics the development of life from simple components, and thus cellular automation is an important tool in the creation and study of artificial life.  This can be furthered by combining a set of cellular automation rules with a geneticalgorithm, including a mechanism for inheritance of characteristics.

"Error correction is the process of detecting and correcting errors that occur during the transmission or storage of data.  In computing, errors can occur due to a variety of factors such as data corruption, interference, or noise in the communication channel, or hardware malfunctions. Error correction codes are used to detect and correct errors in data.  These codes are added to the data before transmission or storage, and they are designed to allow the receiver to detect and correct any errors that may occur during the process. One common error correction code is the Hamming code, which is a binary code that adds extra bits to the data being transmitted.  These extra bits are calculated based on the original data and are used to detect and correct errors in the transmitted data.  Another commonly used error correction code is the Reed-Solomon code, which is used to correct errors in block codes, such as those used in CDs and DVDs. Error correction is important in computing because it ensures the accuracy and reliability of data transmission and storage.  Without error correction, data could be lost or corrupted during transmission, resulting in errors or incorrect information being received.  Error correction helps to ensure that data is transmitted and stored accurately, which is critical for many applications, such as data transfer, online transactions, and digital communication.",1,247,1405,10,99,0.4008097165991903,0.2550607287449393,4.765182186234818,24.7,36.62471524663678,13.690856502242152,16.094887892376683,14.836745963215662,12.834977578475339,0.38461538461538464,0.28627450980392155,0.12549019607843137,0.06274509803921569,0.00784313725490196,0.10196078431372549,0.07450980392156863,3,0.012145748987854251,14,0,0,0,0,0.05668016194331984,0,3

"Fiber optics is a technology used in telecommunications and networking that involves the transmission of data and information over thin, flexible glass or plastic fibers.  The fibers use light to transmit signals over long distances, offering high-speed and high-bandwidth communication capabilities. In a fiber optic system, light is generated by a laser or LED and transmitted through the fiber optic cable.  The light travels through the fiber by repeatedly bouncing off the walls of the fiber, which are coated with a highly reflective material.

"A network router is a networking device that forwards data packets between computer networks.  It operates at the network layer of the OSI model and uses routing tables to determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination. Routers are commonly used in homes, businesses, and service provider networks to connect multiple networks and facilitate communication between devices.  They can be wired or wireless and may have a variety of features, including built-in firewalls, virtual private network (VPN) support, and Quality of Service (QoS) settings to prioritize traffic. In a typical home or small business network, the router is often the central point of connectivity, connecting devices to the Internet or other networks.  It can be configured to assign IP addresses to devices on the network, manage network traffic, and provide basic security features.

"Many objects are more elaborate or specialized variations ofmore basic objects.  For example, in Microsoft Windows thevarious kinds of dialog boxes are specialized versions of thegeneral Window class.  Therefore, the specialized versionis created by declaring it to be derived from a “base class. ”Put another way, the specialized class inherits the basicdata and functions available in the base (parent) class.  Theprogrammer can then add new data or functions or modifythe inherited ones to create the necessary behavior for thespecialized class. Languages such as C++ allow for a class to be derivedfrom more than one base class.  This is called multipleinheritance.  For example, a Message Window class mightinherit its overall structure from the Window class andits text-display capabilities from the Message class.  However, it can sometimes be difficult to keep the relationshipsbetween multiple classes clear.  The Java language takes thealternative approach of being limited to only single inheritance of classes, but allowing interfaces (specifications ofhow a class interacts with the program) to be multiplyinherited.",0,185,1129,10,112,0.6054054054054054,0.4648648648648649,5.1891891891891895,18.5,28.35675766871168,13.353503067484663,16.581349693251536,14.975302809339372,15.653987730061356,0.32972972972972975,0.2422680412371134,0.10309278350515463,0.1134020618556701,0.02577319587628866,0.08762886597938144,0.05154639175257732,6,0.032432432432432434,6,0,0,0,0,0.032432432432432434,2,2

"Floating point numbers are typically stored in memory using a standardized format, such as the IEEE 754 standard.  This format uses a combination of a sign bit, an exponent, and a mantissa to represent the value of the floating point number. The sign bit indicates whether the value is positive or negative.  It is represented using a single bit, with 0 indicating a positive value and 1 indicating a negative value. The exponent represents the power of 2 by which the mantissa should be multiplied.  It is represented using a fixed number of bits, which depends on the specific floating point format being used.  For example, in single-precision floating point format (which uses 32 bits), the exponent is represented using 8 bits. The mantissa represents the significant digits of the floating point number.  It is also represented using a fixed number of bits, which depends on the specific floating point format being used.  In single-precision floating point format, the mantissa is represented using 23 bits. To store a floating point number in memory, the computer first converts the number to the standardized floating point format, using the appropriate number of bits for the sign, exponent, and mantissa.  The resulting binary representation is then stored in memory at a specific memory address. When a program needs to use the floating point number, it reads the binary representation from memory, converts it back to the original floating point value, and performs the necessary calculations.",1,273,1506,13,95,0.34798534798534797,0.19413919413919414,4.608058608058608,21.0,40.76435155753339,12.198099173553722,15.875905912269548,14.44419872828201,11.969421487603302,0.3443223443223443,0.25,0.16901408450704225,0.06690140845070422,0.017605633802816902,0.08098591549295775,0.04225352112676056,9,0.03296703296703297,16,0,0,0,0,0.05860805860805861,0,0

"Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol (IP), which is the communications protocol used to send and receive data over the internet.  IPv6 was developed to address the limitations of the previous version, IPv4, which was designed in the 1980s and has since run out of available IP addresses. IPv6 uses a 128-bit address format, compared to the 32-bit format used by IPv4, allowing for a significantly larger number of available IP addresses.  This is important as the growth of the internet and the number of devices connected to it has increased dramatically in recent years.  IPv6 also includes additional features, such as improved security and network auto-configuration. Although IPv6 has been available for many years, the adoption has been relatively slow.  This is due to several factors, including the complexity of transitioning from IPv4 to IPv6 and the fact that IPv4 is still widely used and supported.  However, as the demand for IP addresses continues to increase, the transition to IPv6 is becoming more necessary, and many organizations and internet service providers are gradually making the switch.",1,207,1158,8,103,0.4975845410628019,0.34299516908212563,4.685990338164252,25.875,35.440000000000026,14.030000000000005,17.46086956521739,16.061879428645646,12.669565217391302,0.3719806763285024,0.21100917431192662,0.10550458715596331,0.07339449541284404,0.045871559633027525,0.10091743119266056,0.06880733944954129,19,0.09178743961352658,11,0,0,0,0,0.05314009661835749,1,0

Backdoor is a hidden feature of an application prepared by its designer ormaintainers.  The backdoor gives the programmer special privileges for running the application.

"A binary tree is a tree in which no node has more than two child nodes.  To move through data stored in a binary tree, a program can use two pointers, one to the current node’s left child and one to its right child ,.  The pointers can then be used to trace the paths through the nodes.  If the tree represents a file that has been sorted ,, comparing nodes to the desired value and branching accordingly quickly leads to the desired record. Alternatively, the data can be stored directly in contiguous memory locations corresponding to the successive numbers of the nodes.  This method is faster than having to trace through successive pointers, and a binary search algorithm can be applied directly to the stored data.  On the other hand it is easier to insert new items into a linked list ,. A common solution is to combine the two structures, storing the linked list in a contiguous range of memory by storing its root in the middle of the range, its left child at the beginning of the range, its right child at the end, and then repeatedly splitting each portion of the range to store each level of children.

"Chess has been an important testbed for the development of artificial intelligence (AI) since the earliest days of computing.  The game's complexity and strategic depth make it an ideal domain for exploring the limits of machine intelligence and testing new AI algorithms. One of the key challenges in developing AI systems for chess is the enormous search space of possible moves.  In the game of chess, there are approximately 10^120 possible games, which is many orders of magnitude larger than the number of atoms in the observable universe.  To overcome this challenge, AI researchers have developed a range of techniques, such as alpha-beta pruning, minimax search, and Monte Carlo tree search, to efficiently explore the search space and find good moves. Another challenge in developing AI for chess is representing the game state in a way that is amenable to machine learning.  Historically, this has been done using hand-crafted features that encode various aspects of the game state, such as the relative values of the pieces and the mobility of the pieces.  However, in recent years, deep learning techniques have been used to automatically learn representations of the game state from raw board positions.",1,216,1217,8,117,0.5416666666666666,0.3888888888888889,4.717592592592593,27.0,40.494445876288665,13.635541237113404,16.71030927835052,15.742502247213078,12.69690721649484,0.3611111111111111,0.29515418502202645,0.07488986784140969,0.09691629955947137,0.022026431718061675,0.12334801762114538,0.048458149779735685,11,0.05092592592592592,11,0,0,0,0,0.05092592592592592,1,3

The serial port receives data a full byte at a time from the computer bus and uses a UART (Universal Asynchronous Receiver-Transmitter) to extract the bits one at a time and send them through the port.  A corresponding circuit at the other end accumulates the incoming bits and reassembles them into data bytes. The data bits for each byte are preceded by a start-bit to signal the beginning of the data and terminated by an stopbit.  Depending on the application, an additional bit may be used for parity ,.  Devices connected by a serial port must “negotiate” by requesting a particular connection speed and parity setting.  Failure to agree results in gibberish being received.",0,201,1017,10,106,0.527363184079602,0.3582089552238806,4.124378109452737,20.1,52.735000000000014,10.375555555555557,14.088888888888889,13.348371206891418,8.526666666666667,0.4228855721393035,0.2358490566037736,0.11320754716981132,0.06132075471698113,0.018867924528301886,0.11320754716981132,0.04716981132075472,5,0.024875621890547265,5,0,0,0,0,0.024875621890547265,0,1
"Netnews, or Usenet, is a distributed system for exchanging news and information in the form of messages posted to newsgroups.  The system is decentralized, meaning that there is no central server or authority that controls it.  Instead, messages are distributed across a network of interconnected servers, which synchronize with each other to ensure that all messages are available to all users.  Here's how the distribution and reading of netnews works:Posting a message: Users can post messages to a newsgroup by composing a message in their newsreader software and submitting it to their local news server.  The message is then propagated to other servers that subscribe to the newsgroup, until it reaches all servers in the network. Replication and synchronization: Each news server stores a copy of all messages it receives, and periodically synchronizes with other servers to exchange new messages and updates.  This ensures that all servers have the same set of messages, and that users can access the latest messages from any server in the network. Reading messages: Users can browse newsgroups and read messages using their newsreader software.  The software retrieves messages from their local news server, and can also retrieve messages from other servers in the network if the local server does not have a copy of a particular message. Message threading: Netnews uses a threading system to group related messages together in a tree-like structure, based on their subject and message ID.  This makes it easy for users to follow a conversation or track the evolution of a discussion over time. Archiving: Messages are typically archived on news servers, and can be accessed by users even after they have been removed from their local server or the server they were originally posted to.  This allows users to search for and access older messages and discussions. Overall, the distribution and reading of netnews is based on a decentralized, peer-to-peer system that relies on the synchronization and replication of messages across a network of servers.  This allows users to access a wide range of topics and discussions from anywhere in the network, while also ensuring that messages are distributed and stored redundantly to prevent loss or corruption.",1,396,2264,15,150,0.3787878787878788,0.23737373737373738,4.790404040404041,26.4,37.61509006499537,13.958484679665737,15.812887650882082,14.362553787682575,12.981058495821731,0.43686868686868685,0.26034063260340634,0.12895377128953772,0.04866180048661801,0.031630170316301706,0.1070559610705596,0.046228710462287104,3,0.007575757575757576,14,0,6,0,0,0.03535353535353535,0,3

"Computing is a complex, pervasive, and increasingly vital human activity.  It is not surprising that human psychology can play an important role in many aspects of computer use. Since the 1960s psychology (in particular see cognitivescience) has contributed to the structuring of interaction between computer systems and users ,.  It is important to note the significant differences between how computers and humans perceive and process information: computers are extremely fast in processing in a highly structured setting (e. g. , a program).  The human brain, on the other hand, while thousands of times slower, is thus far greatly superior in coping with loosely structured data through pattern recognition, the making of analogies, and generalization.  A number of researchers , have promoted the idea of creating a human-computer synergy where the structure of the system takes advantage of both the machine’s computational and data-retrieval abilities and the human user’s ability to work with the larger picture.

"Probability is a measure of the likelihood that a specific event will occur.  It is a mathematical concept that is used to describe the uncertainty or randomness of an event.  Probability is expressed as a number between 0 and 1, where 0 represents an impossible event and 1 represents a certain event. The probability of an event occurring can be calculated by dividing the number of favorable outcomes by the total number of possible outcomes.  For example, if a coin is flipped, the probability of getting heads is 1/2 or 0. 5, since there are two possible outcomes (heads or tails) and one of them is favorable. Probability theory is used in a wide range of fields, including statistics, economics, physics, engineering, and computer science.

"Whether at a business meeting or a scientific conference, the use of slides or transparencies has been largely replaced by software that can create a graphic presentation.  Generally, the user creates a series of virtual “slides,” which can consist of text (such as bullet points) and charts or other graphics.  Often there are templates already structured for various types of presentations, so the user only needs to supply the appropriate text or graphics.  There are a variety of options for the general visual style, as well as for transitions (such as dissolves) between slides.  Another useful feature is the ability to time the presentation and provide cues for the speaker.  Finished presentations can be shown on a standard monitor screen (if the audience is small) or output to a screen projectorMicrosoft PowerPoint is the most widely used presentation program.  It includes the ability to import Excel spreadsheets, Word documents, or other items created by Microsoft Office suite applications.  The user can switch between outline view (which shows the overall structure of the presentation) to viewing individual slides or working with the slides as a collection. There are a number of alternatives available including Apple’s Keynote and Open Office, which includes a presentation program comparable to PowerPoint.  Another alternative is to use HTML Web-authoring programs to create the presentation in the form of a set of linked Web pages.

"In 1982, Andrew Fuegelman created a program called PC-Talk.  This program provided a better way for users with modems to connect to the many bulletin board systems that were starting to spring up.  Fluegelman was familiar with the common practice of public radio and TV broadcasters of soliciting pledge payments to help support their “free” service.  He decided to do something similar with his program.  He distributed it to many bulletin boards, where users could download it for free.  However, he asked users who liked the program and wanted to continue to use it to pay him $25. Fluegelman dubbed his method of software distribution “freeware” (because it cost nothing to try out the program).  Other programmers began to use the same method with their own software.  This included Jim Knopf, author of the PC-File database program, and Bob Wallace, who offered PC-Write as a full-featured alternative to expensive commercial word processing program.  Because Fluegelman had trademarked the term freeware, these other authors began to call their offerings shareware. Today freeware means software that can be downloaded at no cost and for which there is no charge for continued use.  The program may be redistributed by users as long as they don’t charge for it",0,232,1267,12,137,0.5905172413793104,0.4353448275862069,4.543103448275862,19.333333333333332,57.849563008130076,9.434451219512194,11.321138211382113,11.37473899888905,11.439024390243901,0.39655172413793105,0.20967741935483872,0.14112903225806453,0.06451612903225806,0.016129032258064516,0.08870967741935484,0.036290322580645164,10,0.04310344827586207,7,0,0,0,0,0.03017241379310345,1,6
"DVD-ROM is a type of optical disc that is used to store digital data.  The acronym ""DVD"" stands for Digital Versatile Disc or Digital Video Disc.  The ""ROM"" in DVD-ROM stands for Read-Only Memory, which means that the data on the disc can only be read and not written or erased. A DVD-ROM can store up to 4. 7 gigabytes (GB) of data on a single-sided, single-layer disc, and up to 8. 5 GB on a single-sided, dual-layer disc.  This makes it an excellent medium for storing large amounts of data, including movies, music, software, and other digital files. DVD-ROMs are commonly used for distributing commercial movies, software applications, and games.  They can be played on DVD-ROM drives, which are available in most computers and DVD players. The data on a DVD-ROM is stored in a series of pits and lands on the surface of the disc.  A laser in the DVD-ROM drive reads the pits and lands as the disc spins, translating them into digital data that can be used by the computer or other device.",1,206,994,11,97,0.470873786407767,0.30097087378640774,3.966019417475728,18.727272727272727,60.97391371340524,8.752121212121214,12.990035952747817,12.40481918309499,7.657627118644072,0.39805825242718446,0.20425531914893616,0.08085106382978724,0.07234042553191489,0.00851063829787234,0.10212765957446808,0.05106382978723404,6,0.02912621359223301,12,0,0,0,0,0.05825242718446602,0,2
"The use of a processor cache is advantageous because instructions and data can be fetched more quickly from the cache (static memory chips next to or within the CPU) than they can be retrieved from the main memory (usually dynamic RAM).  An algorithm analyzes the instructions currently being executed by the processor and tries to anticipate what instructions and data are likely to be needed in the near future.  (For example, if the instructions call for a possible branch to one of two sets of instructions, the cache will load the set that has been used most often or most recently.  Since many programs loop over and over again through the same instructions until some condition is met, the cache’s prediction will be right most of the time. )",0,143,749,4,89,0.6223776223776224,0.46153846153846156,4.321678321678322,35.75,42.828437500000035,15.235312500000003,19.675,16.827784334635936,10.64375,0.4755244755244755,0.2,0.08275862068965517,0.06896551724137931,0.0896551724137931,0.09655172413793103,0.09655172413793103,4,0.027972027972027972,3,0,0,0,0,0.02097902097902098,0,0

"Python is particularly useful for system administrators, webmasters, and other people who have to link various files, data source, or programs to perform their daily tasks.  The language currently has a small but growing (and quite enthusiastic) following. Without the semicolons and braces found in C and related languages, Python looks rather like BASIC.  Also note that the type of input data doesn’t have to be declared.  The runtime mechanism will assume it’s numeric from the expression found in the print statement.  Python programs thus tend to be shorter and simpler than C, Java, or even Perl programs.  The simple syntax and lack of data typing does not mean that Python is not a “serious” language, however.  Python contains full facilities for object-oriented programming, for example. Python programs can be written quickly and easily by trying commands out interactively and then converted the script to bytecode, a machine-independent representation that can be run on an interpreter designed for each machine environment.

SFTP is often used for transferring sensitive data, such as financial or medical records. FTPS (FTP over SSL): Another secure version of FTP that encrypts data during transfer.  FTPS uses SSL/TLS encryption, which is commonly used for secure web connections. HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol): The protocol used for transferring data over the web, including web pages, images, and other types of files.  While not specifically designed for file transfer, HTTP can be used to transfer files, particularly smaller files. HTTPS (HTTP Secure): A secure version of HTTP that uses SSL/TLS encryption to protect data during transfer.

When errors are found, the soundness of the algorithm and its implementation must be checked, as well as the program logic ,.  Interaction between the program and other programs (including the operating system) as well as with hardware must also be considered.  (See bugsand debugging. )However, even well-tested software is likely to encounter errors.  Therefore a program intended for widespread use must include instructions for dealing with errors, anticipated or otherwise.  The process of error handling can be divided into four stages: validation, detection, communication, and amelioration.",0,153,856,8,93,0.6078431372549019,0.45751633986928103,4.7254901960784315,19.125,32.39160714285714,12.6540873015873,13.919047619047621,13.81666964889586,14.26666666666667,0.3333333333333333,0.2392638036809816,0.11042944785276074,0.03067484662576687,0.0736196319018405,0.09202453987730061,0.07975460122699386,1,0.006535947712418301,10,0,1,0,0,0.06535947712418301,2,0

"A compiler is a software program that translates source code written in a programming language into machine code, which is a language that computers can understand and execute.  The process of converting source code into machine code is called compilation. The compiler takes the source code, analyzes its syntax and structure, and translates it into an equivalent program in machine code.  The machine code is then executed by the computer's processor, performing the operations specified in the source code. Compilers are essential tools for software development, as they allow programmers to write code in high-level programming languages and then translate that code into machine code that can be executed on a variety of computer systems.  This enables developers to write code that is more abstract and expressive, without having to worry about the specifics of the underlying hardware. Compilers are also used to optimize code for performance, by generating machine code that is more efficient and faster than code written by humans.  Additionally, compilers can detect errors and bugs in the source code during the compilation process, helping to identify and fix issues before the program is run. There are many different compilers available for different programming languages, and some languages even have multiple compilers that can be used depending on the specific needs of the programmer.",1,237,1403,9,110,0.4641350210970464,0.3037974683544304,4.991561181434599,26.333333333333332,33.43503328213009,14.58568356374808,18.676702508960574,16.860833078287435,14.030414746543784,0.4050632911392405,0.3045267489711934,0.13991769547325103,0.053497942386831275,0.02880658436213992,0.102880658436214,0.06172839506172839,0,0.0,10,0,0,0,0,0.04219409282700422,0,0

"By the mid-1990s, many thousands of pages were being added to the World Wide Web each day ,.  The availability of graphical browsing programs such as Mosaic, Netscape, and Microsoft Internet Explorer , made it easy for ordinary PC users to view Web pages and to navigate from one page to another.  However, people who wanted to use the Web for any sort of systematic research found they needed better tools for finding the desired information. There are basically three approaches to exploring the Web: casual “surfing,” portals, and search engines.  A user might find (or hear about) an interesting Web page devoted to a business or other organization or perhaps a particular topic.  The page includes a number of featured links to other pages.  The user can follow any of those links to reach other pages that might be relevant.  Those pages are likely to have other interesting links that can be followed, and so on.  Most Web users have surfed in this way: It can be fun and it can certainly lead to “finds” that can be bookmarked for later reference.  However, this approach is not systematic, comprehensive, or efficient. Alternatively, the user can visit a site such as the famous Yahoo! started by Jerry Yang and David Filo ,.  These sites specialize in selecting what their editors believe to be the best and most useful sites for each topic, and organizing them into a multilevel topical index.  The portal approach has several advantages: The work of sifting through the Web has already been done, the index is easy to use, and the sites featured are likely to be of good quality.  However, even Yahoo!’s busy staff can examine only a tiny portion of the estimated 1 trillion or so Web pages being presented on about 175 million different Web sites (as of 2008).  Also, the sites selected and featured by portals are subject both to editorial discretion (or bias) and in some cases to commercial interest.",0,377,1916,16,192,0.5092838196286472,0.35809018567639256,4.180371352785146,23.5625,50.86904186214363,10.928087333092744,12.45586430891375,12.72843380041369,9.788343558282207,0.40318302387267907,0.17525773195876287,0.1134020618556701,0.10051546391752578,0.03865979381443299,0.08762886597938144,0.06958762886597938,15,0.03978779840848806,19,0,3,2,0,0.05570291777188329,3,4

"In computing, colors are typically represented using combinations of red, green, and blue (RGB) values.  Each pixel on a computer screen is made up of three small subpixels, one red, one green, and one blue, and the intensity of each subpixel determines the overall color of the pixel. The RGB color model is based on the additive color theory, which states that by adding different intensities of red, green, and blue light together, all colors can be created.  The values for each color component are typically represented as numbers ranging from 0 to 255, with 0 indicating no intensity and 255 indicating full intensity. In addition to the RGB color model, there are other color models used in computing, such as CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Key/Black) used in printing, and the HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) color models used in image processing and graphic design. Color is an important aspect of user interfaces and web design, as it can affect the mood and tone of a website or application.

"In object-oriented programming (OOP), a class is a blueprint or template for creating objects.  It defines a set of properties (also known as attributes or fields) and methods that are common to all objects of a certain type. A class provides a way to encapsulate data and functionality, allowing for modular and organized programming.  It defines the behavior and properties of a certain type of object, but does not create any actual objects itself.  Instead, an object is created from a class using a process called instantiation. A class can be thought of as a template or a cookie cutter, while an object is an instance of that template or cookie cutter.  For example, a class called ""Person"" might define attributes such as name, age, and address, and methods such as ""walk"" and ""speak"".  An object created from the Person class would have specific values for those attributes (such as ""John"", 30, and ""123 Main St. ""), and would be able to perform the methods defined in the class. Classes can also inherit properties and methods from other classes, allowing for more complex relationships and structures.  This is known as inheritance and is a key feature of OOP.",1,236,1171,10,105,0.4449152542372881,0.2542372881355932,4.1440677966101696,23.6,56.3892524227042,9.843276419012462,12.442824180895247,11.911945987284739,9.839593908629439,0.3940677966101695,0.2336065573770492,0.09836065573770492,0.05737704918032787,0.01639344262295082,0.09836065573770492,0.05737704918032787,3,0.012711864406779662,13,0,0,0,0,0.05508474576271186,0,4
"CMYK stands for Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and Key (Black), which are the primary colors used in printing.

When all four colors are combined at their full intensity, they absorb all the light and produce black. In the CMYK color model, each color component is typically represented as a percentage value ranging from 0% to 100%, where 0% indicates no ink and 100% indicates full ink coverage.

"Active Server Pages (ASP) is a server-side scripting language used for creating dynamic web pages and web applications.  It was first introduced by Microsoft in the late 1990s as a technology for building server-side web applications on Windows servers. ASP scripts are written in a scripting language such as VBScript or JScript and are embedded in HTML pages.  When a user requests an ASP page, the web server executes the ASP script on the server and generates dynamic HTML pages to be sent back to the client's browser. ASP provides a wide range of functionality for creating dynamic web pages, including database connectivity, form processing, session management, and authentication.  It can also be used with other web technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS), JavaScript, and XML. In addition to classic ASP, Microsoft also developed ASP. NET, which is a more modern web application framework that supports multiple programming languages, including C#, Visual Basic, and F#.  ASP. NET is designed to be more modular, scalable, and secure than classic ASP and provides a wide range of built-in features for creating dynamic web applications.",1,214,1156,10,110,0.514018691588785,0.32710280373831774,4.5327102803738315,21.4,44.27207650273226,12.135628415300548,16.002185792349728,14.554592549557764,12.409836065573774,0.29906542056074764,0.23660714285714285,0.09375,0.08035714285714286,0.026785714285714284,0.09375,0.044642857142857144,24,0.11214953271028037,14,0,0,0,0,0.06542056074766354,0,2

"While telecommuting or remote work has many advantages, there are also some potential disadvantages that may affect both employees and organizations.  Some of the disadvantages of telecommuting include:Lack of social interaction: Telecommuting can lead to a lack of social interaction, which can be challenging for some employees who may feel isolated and disconnected from their colleagues. Reduced productivity: Telecommuting may lead to reduced productivity, particularly if employees are not disciplined enough to stay on task or if they lack access to the necessary resources and tools. Difficulty with team collaboration: Collaborating with team members can be challenging when working remotely, particularly if there are time zone differences, and communication and coordination can be slower. Difficulty separating work and personal life: Telecommuting can make it difficult to separate work and personal life, which can lead to burnout and stress. Limited career growth: Telecommuting may limit career growth opportunities for employees, particularly if they are not able to network and build relationships with colleagues and managers. Dependence on technology: Telecommuting requires access to and dependence on technology, which can be challenging for some employees who may not be as comfortable with technology or who may not have access to high-speed internet or a reliable computer.

"Steganography (“hidden writing”) is a form of data hiding.  Unlike cryptography, which creates an unreadable version of a message for anyone withoutthe key, Steganography conceals even the existence of secret messages.  Oneof the earliest forms of Steganography is spread-spectrum radio transmissions, in which parts of a message (even parts of individual bits) are senton pseudo-randomly varying radio frequencies; without the right equipment,the signal is merely electronic white noise. Steganography circumvents restrictions on encryption and preventsSIGINT (signals intelligence) personnel from detecting encrypted traffic. Digital watermarks and copy-protection schemes are forms of Steganography used to reduce the ease of illegal copying of intellectual property and totrace the origin of files ,. There are many tools available for embedding secret messages in otherfiles; for instance, MP3STEGO modifies MP3 audio files to hold messages.

Fractals  can  also  be  used  to  compress  large  digital  images into  a  much  smaller  equivalent  by  creating  a  mathemati-cal  transformation  that  preserves  (and  can  be  used  to  re-cre  ate)  the  essential  characteristics  of  the  image.  military experts can use fractal analysis either to distinguish artifi-cial  objects  from  surrounding  terrain  or  camouflage,  or  to generate more realistic camouflage.

"When people think of a computer, they generally think of a general-purpose computing system housed in a separate box, for use on the desk or as a laptop or hand-held device.  However, the personal computer and its cousins are only the surface of a hidden web of computing capability that reaches deep into numerous devices used in our daily lives.  Modern cars, for example, often contain several specialized computer systems that monitor fuel injection or enhance the car’s grip on the road under changing conditions.  Many kitchen appliances such as microwaves, dishwashers, and even toasters contain their own computer chips.  Communications systems ranging from cell phones to TV satellite dishes include embedded computers.  Most important, embedded systems are now essential to the operation of critical infrastructure such as medical monitoring systems and power transmission networks.  (The potential vulnerability of embedded systems to the Y2K date-related problems was a major concern in the months leading up to 2000, especially because many embedded systems might have to be replaced rather than just reprogrammed.  In the event, it turned out that there were relatively few date-dependent systems and only minor disruptions were experienced",0,210,1254,8,138,0.6571428571428571,0.5428571428571428,5.038095238095238,26.25,27.777171052631616,15.285131578947368,18.55263157894737,16.827784334635936,14.548421052631586,0.3761904761904762,0.28,0.11555555555555555,0.09777777777777778,0.057777777777777775,0.12,0.02666666666666667,3,0.014285714285714285,10,0,0,0,0,0.047619047619047616,1,2
"There are two primary ways to store font data in computers:Bitmap fonts: Bitmap fonts, also known as raster fonts, store the glyph shapes as a bitmap image.  Each character is represented by a set of pixels, with each pixel representing either the foreground or background of the character.  Bitmap fonts are typically smaller in file size and can be quickly displayed on screen, but they can appear jagged or pixelated when enlarged or printed at high resolutions. Outline fonts: Outline fonts, also known as vector fonts, store the glyph shapes as mathematical outlines that describe the shapes of the characters.  The outlines are usually defined using Bezier curves, which can be scaled and adjusted without losing quality.  Outline fonts are typically larger in file size and can take longer to render on screen, but they offer greater flexibility and can be printed at high resolutions without appearing jagged or pixelated.",1,168,930,6,88,0.5238095238095238,0.2916666666666667,4.625,28.0,47.22800000000001,12.882666666666669,15.066666666666666,13.295006501635747,12.402666666666665,0.34523809523809523,0.2616279069767442,0.13953488372093023,0.0755813953488372,0.040697674418604654,0.10465116279069768,0.06976744186046512,6,0.03571428571428571,8,0,3,0,0,0.047619047619047616,0,2

"Users of modern operating systems such as microsoft Win-dows are familiar with multitasking, or running several programs at the same time.  For example, a user might be writing a document in a word processor, pause to check the e-mail program for incoming messages, type a page address int o a Web browser, then return to writing.  meanwhile, the operating system may be running a number of other pro-grams tucked unobtrusively into the background, such as a virus checker, task scheduler, or system resource monitor. Each running program “takes turns” using the PC’s cen-tral processor.  In early versions of Windows, multitasking was cooperative, with each program expected to periodically yield the processor to Windows so it could be assigned to the next program in the queue.  One weakness of this approach is that if a program crashes, the CPU might be “locked up” and the system would have to be rebooted.  However, Win-dows NT, 2000, and xP (as well as operating systems such as UNIx) use preemptive multitasking.  The operating sys-tem assigns a “slice” of processing (CPU) time to a program and then switches it to the next program regardless of what might be happening to the previous program.  Thus, if a pro-gram  “crashes,”  the  CPU  will  still  be  switched  to  the  next program,  and  the  user  can  maintain  control  of  the  system and shut down the offending program.",0,269,1392,9,135,0.5018587360594795,0.36059479553903345,4.234200743494424,29.88888888888889,46.429561403508785,13.076842105263157,15.22105263157895,13.5591,10.810526315789474,0.3754646840148699,0.22077922077922077,0.08766233766233766,0.07467532467532467,0.03571428571428571,0.09090909090909091,0.05844155844155844,7,0.026022304832713755,18,0,0,0,0,0.06691449814126393,2,1
"By the late 1970s, researchers at many major universities were using the UNIX operating system ,.  In 1979, a suite of utilities called UUCP was distributed with the widely used UNIX Version 7.  These utilities could be used to transfer files between UNIX computers that were linked by some form of telephone or network connection. Two Duke University graduate students, Tom Truscott and Jim Ellis, decided to set up a way in which users on different computers could share a collection of files containing text messages on various topics.  They wrote a simple set of shell scripts that could be used for distributing and viewing these message files.  The first version of the news network linked computers at Duke and at the University of North Carolina.  Soon these programs were revised and rewritten in the C language and distributed to other UNIX users as the “A” release of the News software. During the 1980s, the news system was expanded and features such as moderated newsgroups were added.  As the Internet and its TCP/IP protocol , became a more widespread standard for connecting computers, a version of News using the NNTP (Network News Transmission Protocol) over the Internet was released in 1986.

"Optical  fiber  in  its  modern  form  was  developed  in  the 1950s.   The  glass  fiber  through  which  the  light  passes  is surrounded  by  a  transparent  cladding  designed  to  provide the needed refractive index to keep the light confined.  The cladding  in  turn  is  surrounded  by  a  resin  buffer  layer  and often an outer jacket and plastic cover.  Fiber used for com-munication is flexible, allowing it to bend if necessary. Early  optical  fiber  could  not  be  used  for  practical  com-munication because of progressive attenuation (weakening) of the light as it traveled.  However, by the 1970s the attenu-ation  was  being  reduced  to  acceptable  levels  by  removing impurities from the fibers.  Today the light signals can travel hundreds of miles without the need for repeaters or amplifi-ers.  In the 1990s a new type of optical fiber (photonic crys-tal)  using  diffraction  became  available.

"The Internet and its perception as a shared cyberspace adds new dimensions to the psychology of computing.  In fact, the emphasis here is not on computation per se but on the representation of ideas and images, communication, social interaction, and identity.  In particular, pioneering work , has illuminated ways in which online interactions affect identity and sense of self—even encouraging the assumption of multiple identities ,.  Indeed, virtual worlds such as Second Life offer new ways to study the formation of communities and social interactions. On the positive side, it has been argued that cyberspace has encouraged people (particularly adolescents) to experiment with new identities in a relatively safe environment, but lack of inhibition and experience can lead to risky behavior such as involvement with sexual predators.  The very fact that many people (particularly the young) may spend several hours a day or more immersed in the online world has also led to concerns; some psychologists have even suggested that “Internet addiction disorder” (IAD) be included as an official mental disorder similar to compulsive gambling.  However, as of 2007, the American Medical Association has not recommended that IAD be classified as a mental disorder, and the American Society of Addiction Medicine has resisted such a status.

"Dating back to the mid-1990s, VBScript is a scripting language developed by Microsoft and based on its popular Visual Basic programming language ,.  It is also part of the evolution of what Microsoft called “active scripting,” based on components that allow outside access to the capabilities of applications.  The host environment in which scripts run is provided through Windows (as with Windows Script Host) or within Microsoft’s Internet Explorer browser. For client-side processing, VBScript can be used to write scripts embedded in HTML pages, which interact with the standard Document Object Model , in a way similar to other Web scripting languages (in particular, see JavaScript).  However, VBScript is not supported by popular non-Microsoft browsers such as Firefox and Opera, so developers generally must use the widely compatible JavaScript instead.  VBScript can also be used for processing on the Web server, particularly in connection with Microsoft’s Web servers ,. Because versions of Windows starting with Windows 98 include Windows Script Host, VBScripts can also be written to run directly under Windows.

"A growing number of people 50 and older have been learning how to use computer technology and especially applications such as e-mail and Web browsing.  However, a substantial number of seniors have expressed reluctance to join the digital world—as of January 2006, the Pew Internet & American Life Project found that only 34 percent of persons 65 and over were online.  Some reasons why seniors have avoided the technology include the following:, the belief that it would be too hard to learn to use it, uncertainty about what can be done online and whether it is worth the effort, fear of well-publicized dangers such as viruses and identity theft, the expense of a personal computer and Internet accessFortunately a number of these factors are gradually being ameliorated.  There are numerous books and courses (such as at adult education or senior centers) that introduce the essentials of computing to seniors.  Properly installed security and filtering software, together with some user education, can minimize the chances of being victimized online.

"The term word processor was actually coined by IBMin the 1960s to refer to a system consisting of a Selectric typewriter with magnetic tape storage.  This allowed the typist to record keystrokes (and some data such as margin settings) on tape.  Material could be corrected by being rerecorded.  The tape could then be used to print as many perfect copies of the document as required.  A version using magnetic cards instead of tape appeared in 1969. The first modern-style word processor was marketed by Lexitron and Linolex.  It also used magnetic tape, but it added a video display screen.  Now the writer could see and correct text without having to print it first.  A few years later, a new invention, the floppy disk, became the standard storage medium for dedicated word processing systems. The word-processing systems developed by Wang, Digital Equipment Corporation, Data General, and others became a feature in large offices in the late 1970s.  These systems were essentially minicomputers with screens, keyboards, and printers and running a specialized software program.  Because these systems were expensive (ranging from about $8,000 to $20,000 or more), they were not affordable by smaller businesses.  Typically, they were operated by specially trained personnel (who became known also as “word processors”) to whom documents were funneled for processing, as with the old “typing poo",0,254,1397,13,148,0.5826771653543307,0.4409448818897638,4.5984251968503935,19.53846153846154,49.298986013986024,10.58727272727273,14.041958041958043,13.274406872562384,12.215454545454541,0.35039370078740156,0.21933085501858737,0.11152416356877323,0.07806691449814127,0.04460966542750929,0.09665427509293681,0.05204460966542751,13,0.051181102362204724,14,0,0,0,0,0.05511811023622047,0,5

"A class is a blueprint or template for creating objects in object-oriented programming.  A class defines the properties and behaviors that objects created from the class will have.  Classes are a key concept in object-oriented programming, as they provide a way to encapsulate data and logic into reusable and modular components.  A class can define data members, also known as fields or attributes, which represent the state of an object, as well as methods, which represent the behavior of an object.  Classes can also define constructors, which are special methods used to create and initialize objects of the class, and destructors, which are used to clean up resources when an object is no longer needed.  Classes can also have inheritance relationships, where one class can inherit the properties and behaviors of another class.  This allows for the creation of specialized classes that build upon the properties and behaviors of more general classes. In summary, a class is a blueprint for creating objects, encapsulating both data and behavior into a reusable component, and providing the foundation for the object-oriented programming paradigm.",1,200,1153,8,90,0.45,0.265,4.84,25.0,34.067500000000024,14.097222222222225,17.88888888888889,16.218646115125612,13.334444444444447,0.415,0.2783018867924528,0.1320754716981132,0.03773584905660377,0.0330188679245283,0.08962264150943396,0.05188679245283019,4,0.02,12,0,0,0,0,0.06,0,4

"There are a number of ways that sound can be sampled, stored, or generated digitally ,.  Here we will look at some of the most popular sound file formats. WAVThe WAV (wave) file format is specific to Microsoft Windows.  It essentially stores the raw sample data that represents the digitized audio content, including information about the sampling rate (which in turns affects the sound quality).  Since WAV files are not compressed, they can consume considerable disk space. AIFFAIFF stands for Audio Interchange File Format, and is specific to the Apple Macintosh and to Silicon Graphics (SGI) platforms.  Like WAV, it stores actual sound sample data.  A variant, AIFF-C, can store compressed sound. AUThe AU (audio) file format was developed by Sun Microsystems and is used mainly on UNIX systems, and also in Java programming. MIDIMIDI stands for Musical Instrument Digital Interface.  Unlike most other sound formats, MIDI files don’t represent sampled sound data.  Rather, they represent virtual musical instruments that synthesize sound according to complex algorithms that attempt to mirror the acoustic characteristics of real pianos, guitars, or other instruments.  Since MIDI is like a “score” for the virtual instruments rather than storing the sounds, it is much more compact than sampled sound formats.  MIDI is generally used for music composition rather than casual listening. MP3MP3 is actually a component of the MPEG (Moving Picture Expert Group) multimedia standard, and stands for MPEG1 Audio Layer 3.  It is now the most popular sound format, using compression to provide a balance of sound quality",0,297,1620,16,157,0.5286195286195287,0.37373737373737376,4.572390572390573,18.5625,44.81303571428572,10.921547619047619,14.712698412698414,13.526455162492045,12.517460317460316,0.2996632996632997,0.18770226537216828,0.10679611650485436,0.08414239482200647,0.04854368932038835,0.08090614886731391,0.05177993527508091,18,0.06060606060606061,17,0,0,0,0,0.05723905723905724,0,4

"The servers are linked into a branching distribution system.  Messages being posted by users are forwarded to the nearest major regional “node” site, which in turn distributes them to other major nodes.  In turn, when messages arrive at a major node from another region, they are distributed to all the smaller sites that share the newsfeed.  Due to the volume of groups and messages, many sites now choose to receive only a subset of the total newsfeed.  Sites also determine when messages will expire (and thus be removed from the site). There are dozens of different news reading programs that can be used to view the available newsgroups and postings.  On UNIX systems, programs such as elm and tin are popular, while other newsreaders cater to Windows, Macintosh, and other systems.  Major Web browsers such as Netscape and Internet Explorer offer simplified news reading features.

"YouTube, like all major social media platforms, can be influenced by political actors in a variety of ways.

For example, governments may pressure YouTube to remove certain videos or channels that they view as being harmful or threatening to national security. Advertising policies: Political campaigns can use YouTube's advertising platform to target voters with their messages.  YouTube has faced criticism in the past for allowing misleading or deceptive political ads to run on the platform. Algorithmic recommendations: YouTube's recommendation algorithm can influence what videos users see on the platform, which in turn can affect their political views.  Political groups may try to manipulate the algorithm to promote their own videos or suppress those of their opponents.

"This concept refers to the organization of data processing and communications across an entire corporation or other organization.  Historically, computing technology and infrastructure often developed at different rates in the various departments of a corporation.  For example, by the 1970s, departments such as payroll and accounting were making heavy use of electronic data processing (EDP) using mainframe computers.  The introduction of the desktop computer in the 1980s often resulted in operations such as marketing, corporate communications, and planning being conducted using a disparate assortment of software, databases, and document repositories.

"The bubble sort and quicksort are designed to work with records that are in random order.  However, in many applications a database grows slowly over time.  At any given time the existing database is already sorted, so it hardly makes sense to have to resort the whole database each time a new record is added. Instead, an insertion sort can be used.  In its simplest form, the algorithm looks sequentially through the sorted records until it finds the first record whose key is higher than that of the new record.  The new record can then be inserted just before that record, much like the way a bridge player might organize the cards in a hand.  (Since inserting a record and physically moving all the higher records up in memory can be time-consuming, a linked list of key values and associated record number is often used instead.  (See list processing. ) That way only the links need to be changed rather than any records being moved. The insertion sort was improved by Donald L.  Shell in 1959.  His “shellsort” takes a recursive approach (like that in the quicksort), and applies the insertion sort procedure to successively smaller partitions. Another improvement on the insertion sort is the mergesort.  As the name implies, this approach begins by creating two small lists of sorted records (using a simple comparison algorithm), then merging the lists into longer lists.  Merging is accomplished by looking at the two keys on the top of two lists and taking whichever is lowest until the lists are exhausted.  The merge sort also lends itself to a recursive approach, and it is comparable in speed and stability to the heapsort",0,310,1638,15,158,0.5096774193548387,0.36451612903225805,4.351612903225806,20.666666666666668,58.03894334532376,9.480494604316547,11.69820143884892,11.698219412168324,9.910791366906473,0.3870967741935484,0.2222222222222222,0.11728395061728394,0.06481481481481481,0.05246913580246913,0.09876543209876543,0.06481481481481481,6,0.01935483870967742,10,0,0,0,0,0.03225806451612903,1,2
"DSL (digital subscriber line) is one of the two most prevalent forms of high-speed wired access to the Internet ,.  DSL can operate over regular phone lines (sometimes called POTS or “plain old telephone service”).  DSL takes advantage of the fact that existing phone lines can carry frequencies far beyond the narrow band used for voice telephony.  When installing DSL, the phone company must evaluate the quality of existing lines to determine how many frequency bands are usable, and thus how much data can be transmitted.  Further, because the higher the frequency the shorter the distance the signal can travel, the available bandwidth drops as one gets farther from the central office or a local DSL access Multiplexer (DSLAM)",0,135,732,5,91,0.674074074074074,0.5481481481481482,4.518518518518518,27.0,45.22676271186441,12.814000000000004,16.55864406779661,15.381575749822971,12.044067796610172,0.3037037037037037,0.2127659574468085,0.09929078014184398,0.12056737588652482,0.0425531914893617,0.06382978723404255,0.05673758865248227,6,0.044444444444444446,5,0,0,0,0,0.037037037037037035,1,0
"While spam can appear in any communications medium (including chat, instant messaging, and even blogs), the most prevalent type is e-mail spam, which costs U. S.  businesses billions of dollars a year in processing expenditures, lost time, and damage caused by malicious software (malware) for which spam can be either a delivery vehicle or an inducement.  In 2007 an estimated 90 billion spam messages were sent each day. The fundamental driving force of spam is the fact that, given one has Internet access, sending e-mail costs essentially nothing, no matter how many messages are sent.  Thus even if only a tiny number of people respond to a spam solicitation (such as for sexual-enhancement products), the result is almost pure profit for the spammer. Besides directly making fraudulent solicitations for products that are ineffective, counterfeit, or nonexistent, spam carries two other dangers: inducements to click to visit fake Web sites , and attachments containing viruses or other dangerous software ,",0,183,1013,5,121,0.6612021857923497,0.5136612021857924,4.655737704918033,36.6,32.629973460721885,15.20863057324841,18.1099787685775,16.11434528070225,13.39872611464968,0.3114754098360656,0.296875,0.09375,0.08333333333333333,0.052083333333333336,0.06770833333333333,0.052083333333333336,6,0.03278688524590164,15,0,1,0,0,0.08196721311475409,1,5

"In today’s health care environment patients often have only a few minutes to ask their doctor important questions about their condition and possible treatments.  Patients often feel they have been left on their own when it comes to obtaining detailed information.  According to surveys by the Pew Internet & American Life Project, by the end of 2005 about 20 percent of Web users were reporting that the Internet “has greatly improved the way they get information about health care. ” Further, 7 million users had reported that Web sites had “played a crucial or important role in coping with a major illness. ”A variety of Web sites ranging from comprehensive and excellent to dubious (at best) offer health-related information.  In evaluating them, it is important to determine who sponsors the site and what is the source of the information provided.  The very extensive WebMD site, for example, is reviewed for accuracy by an independent panel of experts.  One of the foremost medical institutions, the Mayo Clinic, also has an authoritative site.  The site OrganizedWisdom. com offers a search engine that emphasizes information that has been reviewed by doctors for accuracy, while eliminating low-quality or duplicative results. Even if information is accurate, however, users may often lack the necessary background or context for interpreting it correctly.  Understanding the results of medical studies, for example, requires some knowledge of how studies are designed, the population used, and the statistical significance and applicability of the results.  As a practical matter, therefore, patients should not make any major decisions about diet, medication, or treatment options without consulting a medical professional.

"Censorship refers to the suppression or control of information or ideas by an authority or group in order to prevent their dissemination or expression.  When it comes to the internet, censorship refers to the control or suppression of information that is transmitted over the internet. Censorship on the internet can take various forms.  Governments may use technical measures such as website blocking, content filtering, and IP address blocking to restrict access to certain websites or information.  They may also monitor online activities and communications to identify and punish individuals who engage in prohibited activities, such as dissent or criticism of the government. Private companies, such as social media platforms and search engines, may also engage in censorship by removing or limiting access to certain content or users based on their policies or community standards.  This is often done to prevent the spread of harmful or offensive content, such as hate speech or misinformation. Advocates of internet censorship argue that it is necessary to protect national security, public order, and social values.  They may also claim that certain types of content, such as pornography or extremist propaganda, are harmful to individuals or society and should be restricted. Critics of internet censorship argue that it infringes on freedom of expression and access to information, which are fundamental human rights.

"A Denial of Service (DoS) attack is a type of cyber attack in which an attacker attempts to make a network, website, or service unavailable to users by overwhelming it with traffic or other forms of disruptive activity. DoS attacks typically involve flooding a targeted system with a large volume of traffic, such as network packets or web requests, in order to consume the system's resources and make it unavailable to legitimate users.  Attackers may also use other methods to disrupt the targeted system, such as sending malformed data, exploiting vulnerabilities in the system's software, or launching attacks from multiple sources to make it more difficult to block the traffic. DoS attacks can be launched from a single source or from multiple sources, in which case it is called a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack.  DDoS attacks are typically carried out using botnets, which are networks of compromised computers that are controlled remotely by the attacker. DoS attacks can have serious consequences for organizations, including lost revenue, damage to reputation, and legal liability.  To protect against DoS attacks, organizations can implement measures such as network filtering, load balancing, and anti-DDoS software, as well as practicing good security hygiene, such as keeping software up-to-date and using strong authentication methods.",1,239,1364,7,122,0.5104602510460251,0.3263598326359833,4.824267782426778,34.142857142857146,24.330956937799044,17.28299384825701,19.789747095010256,16.954822765917157,14.28995215311005,0.34309623430962344,0.2620967741935484,0.12903225806451613,0.09274193548387097,0.028225806451612902,0.11693548387096774,0.04032258064516129,3,0.012552301255230125,17,0,0,0,0,0.07112970711297072,0,0

"There are several advantages to using the client-server model.  Having most of the processing done by one or more servers means that these powerful and more costly machines can be used to the greatest efficiency.  If more processing capacity is needed, more servers can be brought online without having to revamp the whole system.  Users, on the other hand, only need PCs (or terminals) that are powerful enough to run the smaller client program to connect to the server. Keeping the data in a central location helps ensure its integrity: If a database is on a server, transactions can be committed in an orderly way to ensure that, for example, the same ticket isn’t sold to two people.  A client-server model also offers flexibility to users.  Any client program that meets the standards supported by the server can be used to make a connection.",0,162,847,7,96,0.5925925925925926,0.41975308641975306,4.314814814814815,23.142857142857142,50.24250000000001,11.362023809523809,12.673015873015874,12.28987398476788,10.149999999999999,0.4444444444444444,0.22941176470588234,0.1411764705882353,0.08823529411764706,0.029411764705882353,0.08235294117647059,0.07058823529411765,2,0.012345679012345678,6,0,1,0,0,0.037037037037037035,0,1
"Access Control Matrix (ACM) is a security model used to specify the access rights of subjects to objects in a computer system.  The ACM is a table or matrix that lists all the subjects (users, processes, programs) and objects (files, directories, devices) in a system, along with the access rights that each subject has to each object.  The access rights can include read, write, execute, and delete permissions. In an ACM, each row represents a subject and each column represents an object.  Each cell in the matrix indicates the access rights of the corresponding subject to the corresponding object.  For example, a cell may contain the value ""rwx"" to indicate that the subject has read, write, and execute permissions to the object. The ACM provides a way to control and manage access to resources in a system by ensuring that only authorized users or processes can access specific objects.  It is also useful for auditing and tracking user activity, as it provides a clear view of who has access to what resources in the system. ACMs can be implemented using various access control models, such as discretionary access control (DAC), mandatory access control (MAC), and role-based access control (RBAC).  Each of these models uses different methods for assigning access rights to subjects based on their identity, job function, or security clearance level.",1,264,1361,10,111,0.42045454545454547,0.25757575757575757,4.303030303030303,26.4,44.44524324324328,12.57520720720721,14.645765765765766,13.506818969022046,11.370270270270272,0.3484848484848485,0.29044117647058826,0.11764705882352941,0.03308823529411765,0.007352941176470588,0.08823529411764706,0.03676470588235294,7,0.026515151515151516,18,0,0,0,0,0.06818181818181818,0,0

"The famous Turing test , proposes that if a human is unable to reliably distinguish messages from a computer from those of another person, the computer program involved can at least be provisionally declared to be “intelligent. ” The advent of textual communication via the Internet , has afforded a variety of ways to attempt to meet this challenge.  Programs that mimic human conversational styles have come to be known as “chatterbots. ”The prototypical chatterbot was ELIZA, developed by Joseph Weizenbaum in the mid-1960s ,.  ELIZA mimicked a form of nondirective psychotherapy in which the therapist echoes or plays off of the client’s statements as a form of gentle encouragement and validation.  Thus if one types, “My father didn’t really like me,” ELIZA might reply, “Tell me more about your father. ” Although primitive, ELIZA once inadvertently fooled an executive into thinking he was exchanging messages with Weizenbaum.

"With a parallel connection, however, the eight bitsof the byte are sent simultaneously, each along its own wire,so parallel ports are generally faster than serial ports.  Also,since the data is transmitted simultaneously, the protocolfor marking the beginning and end of each data byte is simpler.  On the other hand, parallel cables are more expensive(since they contain more wires) and are generally limitedto a length of 10 feet or so because of electrical interferencebetween the parallel wires. The original parallel interface for personal computerswas designed by Centronics, and a later version of this 36-pin connector remains popular today.  Later, IBM designed a25-pin version.

"In computing, a shell is a program that provides a user interface for accessing an operating system's services and resources.  The shell acts as an intermediary between the user and the operating system, allowing the user to interact with the system by issuing commands and receiving feedback and results. A shell can be thought of as a command interpreter or command-line interface that allows users to enter commands and execute them on the operating system.  The shell also provides access to utilities and programs installed on the system, allowing users to perform tasks such as file management, process management, and system configuration. There are several different types of shells, including the Bourne shell (sh), the C shell (csh), the Korn shell (ksh), and the Bash shell (bash), which is the default shell for most Linux and Unix-based operating systems.  Each shell has its own set of commands and syntax, but they all provide similar functionality and are designed to make it easier for users to interact with the operating system. In addition to providing a command-line interface, some shells also support graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and other advanced features such as scripting and automation.

"In computer science, a tree is a widely-used data structure that represents a hierarchical structure or an abstract model of a set of elements.  It is called a ""tree"" because it resembles a tree that has a root at the top and branches that spread out in different directions. A tree consists of nodes, which are connected by edges or links.  The topmost node in a tree is called the root, and each node in a tree has zero or more child nodes.  Nodes with no child nodes are called leaves. In a binary tree, each node has at most two child nodes, which are called left and right children.  In contrast, a general tree can have any number of child nodes. Trees are used in a wide range of applications, including computer science, data structures, algorithms, and programming languages.

"Computers are involved in pollution and greenhouse gas emissions throughout their entire lifecycle, from manufacturing to disposal.  Here are some ways that computers contribute to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions:Manufacturing: The production of computers and electronic devices involves the extraction of raw materials, such as metals and minerals, which can contribute to deforestation, soil degradation, and water pollution.  The manufacturing process also requires energy and generates greenhouse gas emissions, particularly through the use of fossil fuels. Energy consumption: The operation of computers requires electricity, which is often generated from fossil fuels such as coal, oil, and natural gas.  The use of energy-intensive data centers, servers, and cooling systems also contributes to greenhouse gas emissions. E-waste: The disposal of electronic waste, including computers, can contribute to pollution and greenhouse gas emissions.  Electronic devices can contain hazardous materials, such as lead, mercury, and cadmium, which can pose health and environmental risks if not disposed of properly.

"Web users increasingly have access to such content as news broadcasts, songs, and even full-length videos.  The problem is that the user must receive the content in real time at a steady pace, not in sputters or jerks.  However, factors such as load on the Web server and network congestion between the server and user can cause delays in transmission.  One way to reduce the problem would be to compress the data ,.  However, excessive compression would compromise audio or picture quality to an unacceptable extent.  Fortunately, a technology called streaming offers a way to smooth out the transmission of large amounts audio or video content ,. When a user clicks on an audio or video link, the player software (or Web browser plug-in) is loaded and the transmission begins.  Typically, the player stores a few seconds of the transmission ,, so any momentary delays in the transmission of data packets will not appear as the data starts to play.  Assuming the rate of transmission remains sufficient, enough data remains in the buffer so that data can be “fed” to the playing software at a steady pace.  If, however, there is too much delay due to network congestion, the playback will pause while the player refills its buffer",0,234,1231,10,119,0.5085470085470085,0.32905982905982906,4.3418803418803416,23.4,50.25481707317073,11.34256097560976,13.46829268292683,13.023866798666859,10.62439024390244,0.37606837606837606,0.3008130081300813,0.09349593495934959,0.06504065040650407,0.032520325203252036,0.08536585365853659,0.044715447154471545,3,0.01282051282051282,16,0,0,0,0,0.06837606837606838,3,6
"Challenge-Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) is a network authentication protocol used to verify the identity of a user or device attempting to access a network.  CHAP operates by first establishing a connection between the client and server, after which the server sends a challenge message to the client. The challenge is a random number or string that is combined with a secret key, known only to the client and server.  The client then generates a response message by applying a one-way hashing function to the challenge and secret key, and sends it back to the server. The server uses the same hashing function and secret key to independently generate its own expected response, and compares it to the response received from the client.  If the two responses match, the client is authenticated and granted access to the network. CHAP provides a more secure form of authentication than simpler protocols such as Password Authentication Protocol (PAP), which sends passwords in clear text.  CHAP also supports periodic re-authentication during a session to prevent unauthorized access. Overall, CHAP is a widely used network authentication protocol that provides a higher level of security and authentication than simpler protocols.",1,213,1241,9,99,0.4647887323943662,0.3004694835680751,4.906103286384977,23.666666666666668,35.59427748992516,13.622037996545771,15.417156016119748,14.06817628641468,13.532642487046633,0.38497652582159625,0.2556053811659193,0.1210762331838565,0.06726457399103139,0.04035874439461883,0.08968609865470852,0.02242152466367713,8,0.03755868544600939,7,0,0,0,0,0.03286384976525822,0,1
"As the name implies, a touchscreen is a screen display that can respond to various areas being touched or pressed.  Invented in 1971, the first form of touchscreens to become part of daily life were found on automatic teller machines (ATMs) and point-of-sale credit card processors. Touchscreens can detect the pressure of a finger or stylus in several ways: A “resistive” touchscreen uses two layers of electrically conductive metallic material separated by a space.  When an area is touched, the two layers are electrically connected, and the change in electrical current is registered and converted to a code that identifies the location touched.  Surface acoustic wave (SAW) touchscreens use an ultrasonic wave that is interrupted by a touch; capacitive touchscreens respond to the change in electron storage (capacitance) caused by contact with a human body.

"Selection sort is a simple sorting algorithm that works by repeatedly finding the smallest element from the unsorted part of an array and moving it to the beginning of the array.  The algorithm maintains two subarrays: the sorted subarray, which starts as empty, and the unsorted subarray, which starts as the entire array. The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted subarray and swapping it with the first element in the unsorted subarray.  This effectively moves the smallest element to the beginning of the array and expands the sorted subarray by one element.  The algorithm then repeats this process for the remainder of the unsorted subarray until the entire array is sorted. In each step of the algorithm, the smallest element in the unsorted subarray is identified and swapped with the first element in the unsorted subarray.  After four steps, the array is sorted in ascending order. Selection sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large arrays.  However, it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or as a building block for more complex sorting algorithms.",1,207,1140,9,85,0.4106280193236715,0.25120772946859904,4.584541062801932,23.0,40.07068924539516,12.83204991087344,17.081164587046942,15.760457277294734,11.589304812834222,0.42995169082125606,0.2,0.10476190476190476,0.11904761904761904,0.023809523809523808,0.13333333333333333,0.02857142857142857,5,0.024154589371980676,7,0,1,0,0,0.033816425120772944,1,0

"According to the OSI (open systems interconnection) model, a network can be considered to be a series of seven layers laid one atop another ,. The physical layer is at the bottom.  It specifies the physical connections between the computers, which can be anything from ordinary phone lines to cable, fiber optic, or wireless.  This layer specifies the required electrical characteristics (such as voltage changes and durations that constitute the physical signal that is recognized as either a 1 or 0 in the “bit stream. ”The next layer, called the data link layer, specifies how data will be grouped into chunks of bits (frames or packets) and how transmission errors will be dealt with ,. The network layer groups the data frames as parts of a properly formed data packet and routes that packet from the sending node to the specified destination node.  A variety of routing algorithms can be used to determine the most efficient route given current traffic or line conditions. The transport layer views the packets as part of a complete transmission of an object (such as a Web page) and ensures that all the packets belonging to that object are sorted into their original sequence at the destination.  This is necessary because packets belonging to the same message may be sent via different routes in keeping with traffic or line conditions. The session layer provides application programs communicating over the network with the ability to initiate, terminate, or restart an interrupted data transfer. The presentation layer ensures that data formats are consistent so that all applications know what to expect.  This layer can also provide special services ,.

"Active OS fingerprinting is a technique used to identify the operating system running on a remote system or device by sending specific network packets and analyzing the responses.  This technique involves actively probing the target system by sending network packets that elicit specific responses from the operating system. Active OS fingerprinting is typically performed by security professionals or network administrators to identify vulnerable systems and determine the appropriate security measures to protect the network.  Attackers may also use this technique to identify potential targets for exploits or attacks. The process of active OS fingerprinting involves sending a series of specially crafted packets to the target system and analyzing the responses.  The packets may contain specific flags or options that trigger certain responses from the operating system.  These responses can then be compared to a database of known operating system fingerprints to determine the operating system running on the target system. Active OS fingerprinting is considered an invasive technique as it involves actively probing the target system, and it may trigger security alerts or firewalls on the target system.  However, it is often more accurate than passive fingerprinting techniques, which rely on observing network traffic and may be less reliable in some situations.",1,214,1373,9,96,0.4485981308411215,0.27102803738317754,5.453271028037383,23.77777777777778,19.879631463146353,16.062343234323432,18.284708470847086,16.32212239822248,16.044554455445546,0.3364485981308411,0.3242009132420091,0.1415525114155251,0.0730593607305936,0.045662100456621,0.0776255707762557,0.0502283105022831,0,0.0,3,0,0,0,0,0.014018691588785047,1,1

The program should be written in such a way that it makes as few assumptions as possible about hardwaredependent matters such as how data is stored in memory.  It is also sometimes possible to use standard frameworks that provide the same functions in several different operating systems such as Windows, Macintosh, and UNIX.",0,133,746,5,80,0.6015037593984962,0.42857142857142855,4.661654135338346,26.6,37.42697560975611,14.150341463414637,15.693658536585367,15.112257680678326,11.760975609756095,0.47368421052631576,0.22627737226277372,0.08759124087591241,0.10218978102189781,0.029197080291970802,0.10948905109489052,0.08029197080291971,4,0.03007518796992481,3,0,0,0,0,0.022556390977443608,0,0
"The large computers that first became available in the 1950s , used “line printers. ” These devices have one hammer for each column of the output.  A rapidly moving band of type moves under the hammers.  Each hammer strikes the band when the correct character passes by.  Printing is therefore done line by line, hence the name.  Line printers were fast (600 lines per minute or more) but like the mainframes they served, they were bulky and expensive. The typewriter offered another point of departure for designing printers.  A few early computers such as the BINAC (an offshoot of ENIAC) used typewriters rigged with magnetically controlled switches (solenoids).  However, a more natural fit was with the Teletype, invented early in the 20th century to print telegraph messages.  Since the Teletype is already designed to print from electrically transmitted character codes, it was easy to rig up a circuit to translate the contents of computer data into appropriate codes for printing.  (Since the Teletype could send as well as receive messages, it was often used as a control terminal for computer operators or for time-sharing computer users into the 1970s. )The daisy-wheel printer was another typewriter-like device.  It used a movable wheel with the letters embedded in slim “petals” (hence the name).  It was slow (about 10 characters a second), noisy, and expensive, but it was the only affordable alternative for early personal computer users who required “letter-quality” output.",0,278,1493,14,149,0.5359712230215827,0.3669064748201439,4.482014388489208,19.857142857142858,49.56144067796612,10.534285714285716,14.030992736077483,13.707050652182112,11.935593220338983,0.34532374100719426,0.23310810810810811,0.08783783783783784,0.08445945945945946,0.05067567567567568,0.09797297297297297,0.037162162162162164,13,0.046762589928057555,10,0,0,0,0,0.03597122302158273,4,6
"Many PC users have become acquainted with chatting through participating in “chat rooms” operated by online services such as America Online (AOL).  A chat room is a “virtual space” in which people meet either to socialize generally or to discuss particular topics.  At their best, chat rooms can develop into true communities whose participants develop long-term friendships and provide one another with information and emotional support ,. However, the essentially anonymous character of chat (where participants often use “handles” rather than real names) that facilitates freedom of expression can also provide a cover for mischief or even crime.  Chat rooms have acquired a rather lurid reputation in the eyes of the general public.  There has been considerable public concern about children becoming involved in inappropriate sexual conversation.  This has been fueled by media stories (sometimes exaggerated) about children being recruited into face-toface meetings with pedophiles.  AOL and other online services have tried to reduce such activity by restricting online sex chat to adults, but there is no reliable mechanism for a service to verify its user’s age.  A chat room can also be supervised by a host or moderator who tries to prevent “flaming” (insults) or other behavior that the online service considers to be inappropriate",0,235,1343,9,144,0.6127659574468085,0.4297872340425532,4.812765957446809,26.11111111111111,24.832628726287282,15.454308943089433,17.501355013550135,16.32212239822248,14.022439024390245,0.3446808510638298,0.23673469387755103,0.11428571428571428,0.10612244897959183,0.04081632653061224,0.09795918367346938,0.061224489795918366,3,0.01276595744680851,4,0,0,0,0,0.01702127659574468,1,4

"List processing refers to a method of data processing that involves working with lists of data elements.  A list is a collection of items that are stored in a specific order, and list processing involves manipulating and analyzing these lists to extract meaningful information or perform specific tasks. List processing can be done using various programming languages and tools, such as Python, R, and MATLAB.  Common operations performed on lists include sorting, filtering, searching, merging, and transforming data.  These operations can be used to extract information, perform calculations, or generate reports. List processing is commonly used in data analysis, scientific research, and information management.

"A finite state machine (FSM), also known as a finite automaton, is a mathematical model used to represent a system that can be in one of a finite number of states, and can transition between those states in response to input.  FSMs are used in a variety of applications, including software engineering, circuit design, natural language processing, and many more. An FSM is typically defined by a set of states, a set of inputs, a set of transitions between states, and a set of output actions or behaviors.  The transitions between states are often represented as a directed graph, where each state is a node and each transition is an edge.  The FSM starts in an initial state and transitions between states based on the input it receives.

"Sun Microsystems was a technology company that was founded in 1982 and specialized in developing computer hardware, software, and network solutions.  The company's products included workstations, servers, storage systems, and software, and it was particularly known for its Unix-based operating system, Solaris. In addition to its hardware and software products, Sun Microsystems was also a pioneer in network computing and was a major contributor to the development of the Java programming language.  Java is an object-oriented language that is designed to be platform-independent, meaning that it can run on any system that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed. Sun Microsystems was acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010, and many of its products and technologies have since been integrated into Oracle's offerings.

"A Digital Signature is a cryptographic technique used to authenticate the integrity and origin of a digital message or document in computer security.  It provides assurance that the message or document has not been altered in transit and that it was signed by the intended signer. Digital signatures are based on a mathematical algorithm that creates a unique digital fingerprint of the message or document, called a hash.  The hash is then encrypted using the signer's private key, which is known only to the signer, to create a digital signature.  The recipient of the message or document can then verify the signature using the signer's public key, which can be obtained from a trusted third party, such as a Certificate Authority. The process of verifying a digital signature involves recreating the hash of the original message or document and comparing it to the decrypted digital signature.  If the two hashes match, then the signature is considered valid and the recipient can be confident that the message or document has not been tampered with and was signed by the intended signer. Digital signatures are used in a variety of applications, including email, software distribution, and online transactions.  They provide a secure way to authenticate the identity of the signer and ensure the integrity of the signed message or document.",1,238,1345,9,101,0.42436974789915966,0.2647058823529412,4.718487394957983,26.444444444444443,31.288893985728862,14.912629969418962,19.964118246687054,17.37919286519448,12.323853211009176,0.4495798319327731,0.22633744855967078,0.12757201646090535,0.07818930041152264,0.01646090534979424,0.07818930041152264,0.06995884773662552,6,0.025210084033613446,9,0,0,0,0,0.037815126050420166,0,5

"The process of code generation usually involves multiple passes that gradually substitute machine-specific code and data for the information in the parse tree.  An important consideration in modern compilers is optimization, which is the process of substituting equivalent (but more efficient) constructs for the original output of the front end.  For example, an optimizer can replace an arithmetic expression with its value so that it need not be repeatedly calculated while the program is running.  It can also “hoist out” an invariant expression from a loop so that it is calculated only once before the loop begins.  On a larger scale, optimization can also improve the communication between different parts (procedures) of the program. The compiler must attempt to “prove” that the change it is making in the program will never cause the program to operate incorrectly.  It can do this, for example, by tracing the possible paths of execution through the program (such as through branching and loops) and verifying that each possible path yields the correct result.  A compiler that is too “aggressive” in making assumptions can produce subtle program errors.  (Many compilers allow the user to control the level of optimization, and whether to optimize for speed or for compactness of program size. ) During development, a compiler is often set to include special debugging code in the output.  This code preserves potentially important information that can help the debugging facility better identify program bugs.  After the program is working correctly, it will be recompiled without the debugging code",0,284,1612,12,149,0.5246478873239436,0.38380281690140844,4.76056338028169,23.666666666666668,34.26832835325368,13.675866533864546,16.17543160690571,15.359359093739592,13.240637450199202,0.4154929577464789,0.22033898305084745,0.11864406779661017,0.0711864406779661,0.05084745762711865,0.09830508474576272,0.06779661016949153,0,0.0,8,0,0,0,0,0.028169014084507043,0,3

"Distributed computing is particularly suited to applications that require extensive computing resources and that may need to be scaled (smoothly enlarged) to accommodate increasing needs ,.  Examples might include large databases, intensive scientific computing, and cryptography.  A particularly interesting example is SETI@home, which invites computer users to install a special screen saver that runs a distributed process during the computer’s idle time.  The process analyzes radio telescope data for correlations that might indicate receipt of signals from an extraterrestrial intelligence ,. Besides being able to marshal very large amounts of computing power, distributed systems offer improved fault tolerance.

Simulations are used in many fields, including engineering, physics, biology, economics, and social sciences, to name a few.  They are often used to test hypotheses, explore new ideas, and make predictions about the behavior of complex systems. In a simulation, the system being studied is typically represented by a set of variables and equations, which describe the behavior of the system over time.  The simulation is then run using various input values or scenarios, and the output is analyzed to understand how the system behaves under different conditions. Simulations can be used for many purposes, including predicting the performance of a new product or design, optimizing the operation of a manufacturing process, testing the safety of a new drug, or studying the behavior of a complex ecosystem.  They can also be used to train individuals in a safe, controlled environment, such as flight simulators for pilots or simulators for medical procedures. Overall, simulation is a powerful tool for understanding and predicting the behavior of complex systems, and is widely used in a variety of applications and fields.",1,258,1448,9,119,0.46124031007751937,0.32170542635658916,4.728682170542636,28.666666666666668,19.404000000000025,16.76355555555556,20.311111111111114,18.12316971661352,13.614222222222228,0.38372093023255816,0.2748091603053435,0.1183206106870229,0.07251908396946564,0.022900763358778626,0.10687022900763359,0.05725190839694656,0,0.0,24,0,0,0,0,0.09302325581395349,0,1

"C++ has been one of the most popular programming languages for over three decades, and its growth has been driven by several factors. Performance: C++ is a compiled language that is known for its high performance and efficient use of system resources.  This has made it a popular choice for developing applications that require fast execution times, such as games, scientific applications, and system software. Object-oriented programming: C++ was designed to support object-oriented programming (OOP), which allows developers to organize their code into classes and objects, making code more modular and easier to maintain.  This has made C++ a popular choice for developing large, complex applications. Compatibility: C++ is a widely used language that is supported by a wide range of operating systems and hardware architectures, making it an ideal choice for developing cross-platform applications. Libraries: C++ has a large and growing library of pre-built classes and functions that can be used to perform common programming tasks.  This has made it easier for developers to write code and reduced the amount of time and effort required to develop applications. Community: C++ has a large and active community of developers, who contribute to open-source libraries and share their knowledge through forums, blogs, and other online resources.

"Telecommuting (also called telework) is the ability to work from home or from some location other than the main office.  According to a report by the nonprofit organization WorldatWork, 28. 7 million people worked from home at least one day a month in 2006.  (Self-employed persons, of course, have a much higher rate of working from home. )Telecommuting was made possible by the growing capabilities of home computers and the availability of network connections that allow the worker at home to have access to most of the people and facilities that would be available if the worker were on site.  Workers and companies that promote telecommuting often cite the following advantages:, elimination of stressful, time-wasting commutes, workers may be more productive because they have fewer office distractions, unnecessary meetings, etc. , reduction of traffic, air pollution, and fuel costs, greater flexibility in working hours, the ability of working parents with small children to combine child care and work to some extent, reduction of costs associated with office facilities",0,192,1080,7,113,0.5885416666666666,0.4322916666666667,4.739583333333333,27.428571428571427,31.150538922155704,14.84123182207015,16.96800684345595,15.532846611407376,13.62634730538922,0.3489583333333333,0.2864321608040201,0.11557788944723618,0.06030150753768844,0.03015075376884422,0.12562814070351758,0.035175879396984924,6,0.03125,14,0,1,0,0,0.07291666666666667,0,1

"There are several ways that Optical Character Recognition (OCR) systems can identify characters in an image:Pattern recognition: OCR algorithms compare the shape of characters in an image to a database of known character shapes.  The system then uses pattern recognition algorithms to match the characters in the image to the closest match in the database. Feature extraction: OCR algorithms can also identify characters by extracting features such as lines, curves, and corners in the image.  The system then compares these features to a database of known character features to identify the characters in the image. Neural networks: OCR systems can also use artificial neural networks to identify characters.  These networks are trained using a large dataset of known characters, and then apply this knowledge to identify characters in new images. Edge detection: OCR algorithms can also identify characters by detecting the edges of characters in an image.  The system then uses these edges to identify the shape of the characters and convert them into digital text. Language-specific recognition: OCR systems can also be trained to recognize characters in specific languages, such as English, Chinese, or Arabic.  These systems use language-specific algorithms to identify characters based on the rules and conventions of the language. Overall, OCR systems use a combination of these techniques to identify characters in an image, depending on the complexity of the image and the requirements of the application.  The accuracy of OCR systems can vary depending on factors such as image quality, font type, and language, so it's essential to choose the right OCR system for your specific needs.",1,295,1696,12,109,0.3694915254237288,0.22033898305084745,4.84406779661017,24.583333333333332,32.265006361323174,14.183015267175573,18.656997455470737,16.424793381693185,13.725954198473286,0.36610169491525424,0.29180327868852457,0.10819672131147541,0.06229508196721312,0.029508196721311476,0.11147540983606558,0.029508196721311476,13,0.04406779661016949,11,0,6,0,0,0.03728813559322034,0,4
"Encryption is a process of encoding information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it.  In other words, encryption transforms plain text or data into an unreadable format that can only be deciphered with the correct decryption key or password. Encryption is widely used for protecting sensitive data, such as financial transactions, personal information, and confidential communications, from unauthorized access and interception.  Encryption can be applied to data at rest (stored on a device or server) or data in transit (being transmitted over a network). There are two main types of encryption: symmetric encryption and asymmetric encryption.  Symmetric encryption uses the same key to both encrypt and decrypt data, while asymmetric encryption uses two keys, one for encryption and one for decryption. Encryption algorithms vary in their strength and complexity, with stronger encryption algorithms providing a higher level of security but requiring more processing power and resources.  Some common encryption standards include AES, RSA, and DES. Encryption is an important tool for protecting the privacy and security of digital information, and it is used in many different contexts, such as online banking, e-commerce, email communication, and more.",1,219,1278,9,119,0.54337899543379,0.3698630136986301,4.954337899543379,24.333333333333332,27.784064327485396,14.628596491228073,18.970760233918128,16.860833078287435,15.003157894736837,0.3607305936073059,0.28444444444444444,0.08,0.1288888888888889,0.013333333333333334,0.10666666666666667,0.044444444444444446,5,0.0228310502283105,15,0,1,0,0,0.0684931506849315,0,0
"The tree is a data structure that consists of individual intersections called nodes.  The tree normally starts with a single root node.  (Unlike real trees, data trees have their root at the top and branch downward. ) The root connects to one or more nodes, which in turn branch into additional nodes, often through a number of levels.  (A node that branches downward from another node is called that node’s childnode. ) A node at the bottom that does not branch any further is called a terminal node or sometimes a leaf. Trees are useful for expressing many sorts of hierarchical structures such as file systems where the root of a disk holds folders that in turn can hold files or additional folders, and so on down many levels.

"In  personal  computers  a  chipset  is  a  group  of  integrated circuits that together perform a particular function.  System purchasers  generally  think  in  terms  of  the  processor  itself (such  as  a  Pentium  III,  Pentium  IV,  or  competitive  chips from AmD  or  Cyrix).   However  they  are  really  buying  a system  chipset  that  includes  the  microprocessor  itself  , and often a memory cache (which may be part of the microprocessor or a separate chip—see cache) as  well  as  the  chips  that  control  the  memory  bus  (which connects  the  processor  to  the  main  memory  on  the  moth-erboard—see bus. )  The  overall  performance  of  the  system depends not just on the processor’s architecture (including data  width,  instruction  set,  and  use  of  instruction  pipe-lines)  but  also  on  the  type  and  size  of  the  cache  memory, the memory  bus  (RDRAm  or  “Rambus”  and  SDRAm)  and the  speed  with  which  the  processor  can  move  data  to  and from memory.

"The data structures commonly used in computer science include arrays (as discussed above) and various types of lists.  The primary difference between an array and a list is that an array has no internal links between its elements, data structures? ? ? ? 137while a list has one or more pointers that link the elements.  There are several types of specialized list.  A tree is a list that has a root (an element with no predecessor), and each other element has a unique predecessor.  The guarantee of a unique path to each tree node can make the operations of inserting or deleting an item faster.  A stack is a list that is accessible only at the top (or front).  Any new item is inserted (“pushed”) on top of the last item, and removing (“popping”) an item always removes the item that was last inserted.  This order of access is called LIFO (last in, first out).  A list can also be organized in a first in, first out (FIFO) order.

"The OSI (Open Systems Interconnection) model is a conceptual model that describes the communication process between computing systems.  It is composed of seven layers, each of which defines a specific function in the communication process.  The layers are:Physical layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting raw data between devices using physical connections like cables, wires, or radio signals.  It defines the electrical and physical specifications for the connection. Data link layer: This layer is responsible for transmitting data between devices on the same physical network.  It defines how data is organized into frames for transmission and how errors are detected and corrected. Network layer: This layer is responsible for routing data between different networks.  It determines the optimal path for data to travel and uses protocols like IP (Internet Protocol) to transmit data between networks. Transport layer: This layer provides reliable, end-to-end communication between devices.  It breaks down data into smaller packets for transmission and ensures that they are received correctly at the other end. Session layer: This layer establishes, manages, and terminates connections between devices.  It allows applications on different devices to establish a communication session and manage the exchange of data. Presentation layer: This layer is responsible for data representation and encryption.  It transforms data into a format that can be understood by the application layer and encrypts it for secure transmission. Application layer: This layer provides services to end-users, such as email, file transfer, and web browsing.

"The more than five-century-old art of typography (the design, arrangement, and setting of printing type) was transformed in the latter part of the 20th century by digital technology.  With the exception of some traditional presses devoted to the fine book market, nearly all type used today is designed and set by computer. Most users are familiar with the typefaces distributed with their operating system and software, such as the popular Adobe and TrueType ,.  Many such font designs are based on (and sometimes named after) traditional typefaces, modified for readability using typical displays and printers. For control of composition, there are three overlapping levels of software, ranging from easiest to use (but most limited) to most complex, versatile, and precise.  Modern word processors such as Microsoft Word and Open Office provide enough control for many types of shorter documents ,.  Desktop publishing software adds facilities suitable for layout of fliers, brochures, newsletters, and similar publications that often mix text and graphics ,. More elaborate documents such as books, magazines, and newspapers require more sophisticated facilities to control the layout and flow of text.  Some traditional choices include LaTex (for the Tex typesetting program), used particularly by scientists and other academics, and the older troff and its offshoots on UNIX systems.  More recent programs include Quark, FrameMaker, PageMaker, and InDesign.  Related utilities often used in digital typography include font editors (for design and modification) and utilities to convert fonts from one format to another",0,282,1624,11,155,0.549645390070922,0.41134751773049644,4.875886524822695,25.636363636363637,28.884545454545474,14.650757575757574,18.06060606060606,16.133371291317395,15.009166666666673,0.3262411347517731,0.24914675767918087,0.08532423208191127,0.1296928327645051,0.034129692832764506,0.11945392491467577,0.013651877133105802,14,0.04964539007092199,22,0,0,0,0,0.07801418439716312,0,4

"COBOL (Common Business Oriented Language) is a high-level programming language designed for business applications.  It was first introduced in 1959 and is still widely used today for processing large amounts of data in applications such as banking, insurance, and government. COBOL was designed to be easily readable and understandable by business people, as well as programmers.  It features a rich set of data processing capabilities, including support for complex record structures and file processing. COBOL programs are typically compiled rather than interpreted, and they are often run on mainframe computers.  However, the language has been adapted to run on modern platforms, such as Windows and Unix. Despite its age, COBOL remains an important language in the business world due to its reliability and ability to handle large volumes of data.

"Memory management is a critical component of any computer system, and its role is to manage the use of memory to ensure that programs have the memory they need to function properly, while avoiding issues such as memory leaks and out-of-memory errors. Memory management is responsible for allocating memory to programs and processes as needed, as well as deallocating memory that is no longer being used.  This involves managing a pool of available memory and determining which portions of the memory should be assigned to each program. The memory manager also ensures that each program only accesses the memory that has been allocated to it, and that no program can access memory that belongs to another program.  This is important for maintaining the stability and security of the system. Memory management also plays a role in optimizing the use of memory in a system.  This can involve techniques such as swapping memory contents to and from disk when memory is running low, or compressing memory to make better use of the available space. In short, the role of memory management is to ensure that the system has enough memory to run all its programs and processes, and that memory is used efficiently and securely.  Memory management is a complex and critical component of any computer system, and its proper operation is essential for the overall stability and performance of the system.",1,248,1392,9,105,0.42338709677419356,0.2782258064516129,4.669354838709677,27.555555555555557,30.99372294372293,15.312640692640699,20.30995670995671,18.001758247042904,11.645021645021647,0.45564516129032256,0.26171875,0.12109375,0.0625,0.03515625,0.10546875,0.06640625,0,0.0,8,0,0,0,0,0.03225806451612903,0,5

"Passive RFID tags have no power supply; the power induced by the reading signal is used to transmit the response.  Because this power is very small, passive tags can only be read at distances from about 4 inches (10 cm) to a few yards (meters), depending on the antenna size and type.  The main advantage of passive tags is that the lack of a battery makes them small, lightweight, and inexpensive, making them ideal for attaching to merchandise (they have also been embedded under the skin of pets and, in a few cases, even people).  Smart cards for use in transit systems and similar applications are also passive; the system is activated by “tagging” or bringing the card near the reader. Active RFID tags have their own battery.  Their advantage is that they are able to initiate communication with the reader, and the signal they send is much stronger, more reliable, and with greater range (up to about 1,500 feet [500 m]).  The stronger signal allows for communication in rougher environments (such as outdoors for tracking cattle or shipping containers).",0,213,1062,7,123,0.5774647887323944,0.4084507042253521,4.122065727699531,30.428571428571427,49.60500000000002,12.728571428571431,14.73015873015873,12.785403640627713,10.244444444444447,0.39906103286384975,0.24311926605504589,0.07339449541284404,0.0963302752293578,0.045871559633027525,0.11009174311926606,0.05504587155963303,5,0.023474178403755867,11,2,0,0,0,0.06103286384976526,0,1

"Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that is used for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. XML uses tags to define elements and attributes that can be used to structure and describe data in a hierarchical manner.  This makes XML a flexible and versatile language that can be used to represent a wide variety of data types and document structures. XML is widely used in web development, database management, and other areas where structured data needs to be exchanged between different systems and platforms.  XML documents can be validated using a Document Type Definition (DTD) or an XML Schema, which ensures that the document conforms to a specific set of rules and guidelines. One of the main advantages of XML is its platform independence.  XML documents can be created and processed on any platform or operating system, which makes it an ideal choice for data exchange and integration in heterogeneous computing environments. Overall, XML is a powerful tool for structuring and describing data, and it is widely used in many different industries and applications.",1,199,1130,8,104,0.5226130653266332,0.37185929648241206,4.758793969849246,24.875,37.57338743093925,13.639274861878455,17.226795580110497,15.903189008614273,12.596685082872927,0.3869346733668342,0.2524271844660194,0.11165048543689321,0.0825242718446602,0.014563106796116505,0.07281553398058252,0.07766990291262135,12,0.06030150753768844,6,0,0,0,0,0.03015075376884422,0,0

"Authentication is the process of verifying the identity of a user or system, typically in order to grant access to a resource or system.  Authentication ensures that only authorized users can access the resource or system, and that their actions can be attributed to their unique identity. Authentication can be accomplished using various methods, including:Username and password - the most common form of authentication, where the user enters a username and password that is verified by the system. Biometric authentication - using physical traits like fingerprints, facial recognition, or iris scans to verify a user's identity. Multi-factor authentication - requiring multiple forms of authentication, such as a password and a security token, to increase security. Single sign-on - allowing users to log in once and access multiple resources without needing to enter their credentials again. Authentication is a crucial component of security in computer systems and networks, as it helps to prevent unauthorized access, data breaches, and other security incidents.

"In the 1940s, the main objective in developing the first digital computers was to speed up the process of calculation.  In the 1950s, the machines began to be used for more general data-processing tasks by governments and business.  By the 1960s, computers were in use in most major academic, government, and business organizations.  The desire for users to share data and to communicate both within and outside their organization led to efforts to link computers together into networks. Computer manufacturers began to develop proprietary networking software to link their computers, but they were limited to a particular kind of computer, such as a DEC PDP minicomputer, or an IBM mainframe.  However, the U. S.  Defense Department, seeing the need for a robust, decentralized network that could maintain links between their computers under wartime conditions, funded the development of a protocol that, given appropriate hardware to bridge the gap, could link these disparate networks ,.",0,174,990,6,105,0.603448275862069,0.4885057471264368,4.781609195402299,29.0,34.25000000000003,13.912063492063492,16.847432306255836,16.084390811093357,13.47581699346405,0.3793103448275862,0.23756906077348067,0.10497237569060773,0.08839779005524862,0.011049723756906077,0.11602209944751381,0.03314917127071823,8,0.04597701149425287,15,0,0,0,0,0.08620689655172414,1,0

"Even if scientists have a basic understanding of a system, it may be hard to determine what the overall results of the interaction of the many particles (or other elements) in the system will be.  This is true, for example, in the analysis of events taking place in nuclear reactors.  Fortunately computers can apply the laws of the system to each of many particles and determine the resulting actions from their aggregate behavior ,.  Simulation is particularly important in fields where actual experiments are not possible because of distance or time.  Thus, a hypothesis about the formation of the universe can be tested by applying it to a set of initial conditions believed to reflect those at or near the time of the big bang. However, even the most skilled scientists have trouble relating numbers to the shape and interaction of real-world objects.  Computers have greatly aided in making it possible to visualize structures and phenomena using high-resolution 3D color graphics ,.  Features of interest can be enhanced, and arbitrary (“false”) colors can be used to visually show such things as temperature or blood flow.  These techniques can also be used to create interactive models where scientists can, for example, combine molecules in new ways and have the computer calculate the likely properties of the result.  Finally, computer visualization and modeling can be used both to teach science and to give the general public some visceral grasp of the meaning of scientific theories and discoveries",0,269,1513,10,154,0.5724907063197026,0.45724907063197023,4.687732342007435,26.9,34.90383333333335,14.427740740740742,18.279670781893003,16.887214914478655,12.411522633744859,0.42379182156133827,0.24555160142348753,0.09608540925266904,0.09608540925266904,0.03914590747330961,0.11387900355871886,0.0711743772241993,0,0.0,11,0,0,0,0,0.040892193308550186,2,3

"Besides the microprocessor and associated circuitry, the smart card contains a small amount of RAM (random access memory) to hold “scratch” data during processing, as well as up to 64 kB of ROM (read-only memory) containing the card’s programming instructions.  The program is created on a desktop computer and written to the ROMthat is embedded in the card.  Finally, the card includes up to 64 kB of EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable Read Only Memory) for holding account balances and other data.  This memory is nonvolatile (meaning that no power is needed to maintain it), and can be erased and rewritten by the card reader. “Contact” cards must be swiped through the reader and are most commonly used in retail, phone, pay TV, or health care applications.  “Contactless” cards need only be brought into the proximity of the reader, which communicates with it via radio signals or a low-powered laser beam.

"ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a character encoding standard used to represent text in computers and other devices.  It was developed in the 1960s and has been widely used in computer systems and communication protocols ever since. ASCII defines a set of 128 characters, including letters, numbers, punctuation marks, and control characters, each of which is represented by a unique 7-bit binary code.  The ASCII character set includes uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, basic punctuation, and various control characters such as carriage return and line feed. ASCII is a widely used standard and is supported by virtually all modern computer systems.  It is used in various applications, such as email, text files, and programming languages.  However, because it only includes 128 characters, it has limitations in representing non-Latin languages and complex symbols, which led to the development of other character encoding standards like Unicode. Despite the limitations, ASCII remains an important standard in computing and is still used extensively in certain applications, such as programming and data communication, where it provides a simple and reliable means of representing text.",1,209,1227,8,104,0.49760765550239233,0.3062200956937799,4.985645933014354,26.125,25.23495879120881,15.391291208791213,18.990109890109892,17.122413403193683,15.181318681318686,0.33014354066985646,0.271889400921659,0.09216589861751152,0.09216589861751152,0.041474654377880185,0.08755760368663594,0.041474654377880185,8,0.03827751196172249,17,0,0,0,0,0.08133971291866028,1,1
"Governments have always to varying degrees concerned themselves with the content of public media.  The growing use of the Internet for expressive activities , has prompted authoritarian governments such as that of China to attempt to block “objectionable” material both through filtering techniques , and through pressure on service providers.  Further, users identified as creators of banned content may be subjected to prosecution.  However because of the Internet’s decentralized structure and the ability of users to operate relatively anonymously, Internet censorship tends to be only partially effective ,. In the democratic West, Internet censorship generally applies to only a few forms of content.  Attempts to criminalize the online provision of pornography to minors in the 1996 Communications Decency Act have generally been overturned by the courts as excessively infringing on the right of adults to access such content.

"Video tapes have undergone significant evolution since their inception in the 1950s.  The three primary types of video tapes are VHS (Video Home System), Betamax, and VHS-C (Compact VHS).  Here is a brief history of the evolution of video tapes:Reel-to-Reel Tapes (1950s - 1960s): The first video tape format was the reel-to-reel tape, which was developed in the 1950s.  These tapes were large, heavy, and expensive, and were primarily used for professional and industrial purposes. Cartridge-Based Systems (1960s - 1970s): In the 1960s, video tapes started to be produced in cartridge-based systems, which were easier to handle and store.  The first popular cartridge-based video tape system was the Sony Betamax, which was introduced in 1975.  Betamax was smaller and higher quality than VHS, but lost out in the market due to a lack of licensing agreements. VHS (1970s - 2000s): VHS tapes were introduced in the 1970s, and quickly became the dominant video tape format for home use.  VHS tapes were larger and lower quality than Betamax, but were cheaper and had more available content.  VHS tapes remained popular throughout the 1980s and 1990s, but started to be replaced by DVDs and digital formats in the early 2000s. VHS-C (1980s - 1990s): In the 1980s, VHS-C tapes were introduced as a compact version of VHS.  VHS-C tapes were smaller and easier to handle than VHS tapes, but required an adapter to play in a standard VHS player. Digital Video Tapes (1990s - Present): In the 1990s, digital video tape formats such as DV and MiniDV were introduced, which offered higher quality and smaller size than VHS tapes.  These formats were primarily used by professionals and enthusiasts, and have largely been replaced by digital formats such as DVD and Blu-ray. Overall, video tapes played a significant role in the evolution of home entertainment, but have largely been replaced by digital formats in the 21st century.",1,369,1922,15,128,0.34688346883468835,0.18157181571815717,4.336043360433604,24.6,49.306582524271874,11.499663430420714,16.265889967637545,14.836745963215662,11.444012944983818,0.32791327913279134,0.20100502512562815,0.0728643216080402,0.08793969849246232,0.020100502512562814,0.09547738693467336,0.06030150753768844,38,0.10298102981029811,20,0,6,0,0,0.05420054200542006,1,0

"Bubble sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly iterates through an array of elements and compares adjacent elements, swapping them if they are in the wrong order.  The algorithm continues to iterate through the array until no more swaps are necessary, indicating that the array is sorted. In each step of the algorithm, the current element is compared with the next element and swapped if they are in the wrong order.  The algorithm continues to iterate through the array until no more swaps are necessary, indicating that the array is sorted. Bubble sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large arrays.

By the 1980s, a system of topical news postings , carried on the Internet was becoming widely used in universities, the computer industry, and scientific institutions.  Many new users did not understand the system, and posted messages that were off topic.  Others used their postings as to insult or attack (“flame”) other users, particularly in newsgroups discussing perennially controversial topics such as abortion.  When a significant number of postings in a newsgroup are devoted to flaming and counter-flaming, many users who had sought civilized, intelligent discussion leave in protest. In 1984, Chuq von Rospach wrote a document entitled “A Primer on How to Work with the Usenet Community. ” It and later guides to net etiquette or “netiquette” offered useful guidelines to new users and to more experienced users who wanted to facilitate civil discourse.",0,203,1134,8,128,0.6305418719211823,0.5172413793103449,4.704433497536946,25.375,30.631163793103468,14.390201149425291,16.745977011494254,15.414825405933506,13.672413793103448,0.3448275862068966,0.23444976076555024,0.09569377990430622,0.11961722488038277,0.023923444976076555,0.11483253588516747,0.03349282296650718,5,0.024630541871921183,11,0,0,0,0,0.054187192118226604,0,2

"The developer of each application program that writes data files must define a format for the data.  The format must be able to preserve all the features that are supported by the program.  For example, a word processing program will include special codes for font selection, typestyles (such as bold or italic), margin settings, and so on.

"RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) technology uses radio waves to wirelessly identify and track objects.  While RFID has many benefits, such as improved supply chain management and inventory tracking, there are also privacy and security issues associated with its use.  Here are some of the main concerns:Data privacy: RFID tags can store a lot of data, including unique identification numbers, personal information, and tracking information.  If this data falls into the wrong hands, it can be used for identity theft, tracking individuals, or other nefarious purposes. Unauthorized access: RFID systems are vulnerable to hacking, which could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information, such as credit card data or personal identification. Physical security: RFID tags are small and can be easily hidden, making them difficult to detect.  This can be a problem in high-security areas where individuals may try to smuggle in unauthorized RFID tags to gain access to restricted areas. Interception and eavesdropping: RFID signals are transmitted over the airwaves, which means they can be intercepted and eavesdropped on by third parties.  This can result in the unauthorized access of sensitive data. Tracking: RFID tags can be used to track the movements of individuals and objects, which can raise privacy concerns.  For example, if RFID tags are used in retail stores, they could be used to track customers' movements and buying habits. To mitigate these risks, it's important to implement appropriate security measures, such as encryption, access control, and regular monitoring and audits of RFID systems.  Additionally, individuals should be made aware of the potential privacy and security risks associated with RFID technology, and should be given the option to opt-out of RFID tracking if possible.",1,324,1838,13,151,0.4660493827160494,0.3148148148148148,4.79320987654321,24.923076923076923,28.28379652605463,14.645949820788534,17.760242624758753,16.194650593361626,14.149103942652335,0.3395061728395062,0.27761194029850744,0.10746268656716418,0.09253731343283582,0.014925373134328358,0.07462686567164178,0.08059701492537313,9,0.027777777777777776,21,0,6,0,0,0.06481481481481481,0,2
"Clock speed, also known as clock rate, refers to the frequency at which a computer's central processing unit (CPU) can execute instructions.  It is measured in Hertz (Hz), and typically expressed in Gigahertz (GHz) for modern CPUs. Clock speed represents the number of clock cycles per second that the CPU can execute.  Each clock cycle represents a single unit of work that the CPU can perform.  A higher clock speed means that the CPU can perform more work in a given amount of time, which can result in improved performance. However, clock speed is not the only factor that determines CPU performance.  Other factors, such as the number of cores, cache size, and instruction set, also play an important role in determining overall performance.",1,147,746,7,80,0.54421768707483,0.3741496598639456,4.210884353741497,21.0,59.90822580645164,9.304055299539176,12.569585253456223,12.540900571622839,10.40645161290323,0.32653061224489793,0.2781456953642384,0.10596026490066225,0.07947019867549669,0.026490066225165563,0.09933774834437085,0.046357615894039736,10,0.06802721088435375,9,0,0,0,0,0.061224489795918366,1,3

"In 1921, the Czech playwright Karel Capek wrote a play called R. U. R.  or Rossum’s Universal Robots.  Robot is a Czech word that has been translated as work(er), serf, or slave.  In the play the robots, which are built by factories to work in other factories, eventually revolt against their human masters. During the 1960s, real robots began to appear in factory settings ,.  They were an outgrowth of earlier machine tools that had been programmed by cams and other mechanisms.  An industrial robot is basically a movable arm that ends in a “hand” called an end effector.  The arm and hand can be moved by some combination of hydraulic, pneumatic, electrical, or mechanical means.  Typical applications include assembling parts, welding, and painting.  The robot is programmed for a task either by giving it a detailed set of commands to move to, grasp, and manipulate objects, or by “training” the robot by moving its arm, hand, and effectors through the required motions, which are then stored in the robot’s memory.  By the early 1970s, Unimation, Inc.  had created a profitable business from selling its Unimate robots to factories. The early industrial robots had very little ability to respond to variations in the environment, such as the “work piece” that the robot was supposed to grasp being slightly out of position.  However, later models have more sophisticated sensors to enable them to adjust to variations and still accomplish the task.  The more sophisticated computer programs that control newer robots have internal representations or “frames of reference” to keep track of both the robot’s internal parameters (angles, pressures, and so on) and external locations in the work area",0,331,1703,13,172,0.5196374622356495,0.3806646525679758,4.2749244712990935,25.46153846153846,47.15900000000002,11.252666666666666,14.17159420289855,13.454273218885966,11.17101449275362,0.38368580060422963,0.22781065088757396,0.09763313609467456,0.07988165680473373,0.03254437869822485,0.09763313609467456,0.04437869822485207,11,0.03323262839879154,24,0,0,0,0,0.07250755287009064,1,0

"A smart card, also known as an integrated circuit card (ICC) or a chip card, is a small plastic card with a built-in microprocessor chip that stores and processes data.  Smart cards are used for a variety of applications, such as payment, identification, access control, and transportation. Smart cards have several advantages over traditional magnetic stripe cards, such as:Enhanced Security: Smart cards provide a higher level of security than magnetic stripe cards as the microprocessor chip is capable of storing and processing encrypted data.  This makes it more difficult for fraudsters to copy or tamper with the data stored on the card. Multiple Applications: Smart cards can store and process multiple types of data, such as personal information, financial data, and access credentials.  This makes it possible to use a single card for different applications, such as payment, identification, and access control. Offline Authentication: Smart cards can perform offline authentication, which means that the card can verify the identity of the user without the need for an online connection.  This makes smart cards ideal for applications such as access control and transportation. Convenient and Portable: Smart cards are small and lightweight, making them easy to carry around.

"BitTorrent is a peer-to-peer (P2P) file sharing protocol that enables users to share large files over the internet.  The protocol was developed by Bram Cohen in 2001 and has since become one of the most popular P2P file sharing methods on the internet. BitTorrent works by breaking large files into smaller pieces and distributing those pieces across multiple computers on the network.  Users can download and upload different pieces of the file simultaneously, allowing for faster download speeds and more efficient use of network resources. BitTorrent has been used to share a wide variety of files, including movies, music, software, and games.  While the protocol itself is not illegal, it has been associated with copyright infringement and piracy, as users can easily share copyrighted content without permission.

Phishing is similar to other techniques for manipulating people through deception, fear, or greed that hackers often refer to as “social engineering. ” Unlike oneon-one approaches, however, phishing relies on the ability to send large quantities of e-mail at virtually no cost ,, the availability of simple techniques for disguising both e-mail addresses and Web addresses (URLs), and the ease with which the appearance of a Web site can be convincingly replicated. Although e-mail is the most common “hook” for phishing, any form of communication, including text or instant messages, can be used.

"Transaction processing refers to the process of managing, executing and recording transactions in a computer system or database.  A transaction is a series of operations that must be completed as a single, indivisible unit.  In other words, a transaction is a set of actions that must be performed as a whole, or not at all. Transaction processing systems (TPS) are commonly used in business and finance to manage the flow of data and information.  In these systems, a transaction may involve adding, updating, or deleting records in a database, or executing financial transactions such as processing payments, issuing invoices, and recording receipts. The basic steps of transaction processing include:Begin Transaction: The system initiates a transaction and begins to execute a series of operations. Execute Operations: The system executes the operations or steps required for the transaction. Commit Transaction: If all operations are successful, the transaction is committed, and the system records the changes to the database. Rollback Transaction: If an error occurs during any of the operations, the transaction is rolled back, and the system undoes all of the changes made during the transaction. The use of transaction processing systems ensures data consistency and accuracy, as well as maintaining the integrity of the system.  Additionally, transaction processing systems enable businesses to manage high-volume, complex transactions efficiently and effectively, which helps to minimize errors, reduce processing time, and improve customer satisfaction.",1,269,1566,11,115,0.4275092936802974,0.29739776951672864,4.955390334572491,24.454545454545453,23.400968379446653,15.189762845849803,20.537549407114625,17.64278748958908,15.415652173913045,0.36059479553903345,0.2909090909090909,0.12363636363636364,0.03272727272727273,0.03272727272727273,0.08727272727272728,0.04,1,0.0037174721189591076,20,0,5,0,0,0.07434944237918216,0,2
"C++ is a powerful and versatile object-oriented programming language that was developed in the 1980s as an extension of the C programming language.  It was designed to provide developers with a more powerful and flexible language that could be used to create a wide range of applications, from system software to games and multimedia applications. C++ is a compiled language, which means that it is converted into machine code by a compiler before being executed.  This gives C++ programs excellent performance and makes it a popular choice for developing applications that require fast execution times. One of the key features of C++ is its support for object-oriented programming (OOP).  This allows developers to organize their code into classes and objects, which can be used to encapsulate data and behavior, making code more modular, reusable, and easier to maintain. C++ also includes support for templates, which allow developers to write generic code that can be used with a wide range of data types.  This makes it easier to write code that is both flexible and efficient.",1,192,1082,8,99,0.515625,0.328125,4.708333333333333,24.0,40.57016071428572,13.034964285714288,16.75,15.414825405933506,11.846857142857143,0.40625,0.225,0.135,0.085,0.015,0.09,0.07,7,0.036458333333333336,7,0,0,0,0,0.036458333333333336,0,0

"Web sites such as news providers and blogs , are constantly posting new material.  While readers can periodically visit a site to look for new material, an increasingly popular option is to subscribe to a “Web feed” and receive the latest information automatically.  The most commonly used tool for Web feeds is RSS, which can stand for Really Simple Syndication, Rich Site Summary, or RDF Site Summary, depending on the format used. The data in an RSS feed can include article titles, summaries, excerpts (such as the first paragraph), or the complete article or posting.  Feeds can also include multimedia such as graphics, video, or sound.  The data (and any linked material) is formatted using standard markup elements ,.  As part of the process of setting up a feed on the Web server, the feed is “published” so that it can be found and read using a client program called a reader or aggregator (the latter can combine feeds or organize them in a newspaper-like format for convenience).  RSS readers can be stand-alone applications or be included with many modern Web browsers and e-mail clients.  Alternatively, Webbased readers or aggregators such as NewsGator Online can allow feeds to be read using any Web browser.  Readers of Web pages can find RSS feeds by looking for a “subscribe” icon or the words RSS or XML.  Specialized search engines such as Bloglines can also help users find interesting feeds.

"Social virtualization, also known as social VR (virtual reality), is a technology that creates a shared virtual space where users can interact with each other and digital objects in a simulated environment.  This technology creates a sense of presence, allowing users to feel as if they are in the same physical space even if they are geographically located in different parts of the world. Social virtualization is often used for entertainment and socialization, allowing users to meet and interact with each other in virtual environments.  Users can create avatars to represent themselves, which can be customized to their liking.  They can then explore virtual worlds, attend virtual events, and participate in activities such as games, concerts, and virtual tourism. Social virtualization is also used for collaborative work and education, where users can work together on projects, attend meetings, and participate in virtual training sessions.  Social VR platforms can also enable remote teams to communicate and collaborate more effectively, particularly in industries that require 3D visualization and simulation, such as architecture, engineering, and product design.

"There are several ways to achieve fault tolerance in computing systems.  Some common techniques include:Redundancy: This involves duplicating critical components or systems and configuring them to take over in the event of a failure.  For example, a fault-tolerant computer system may use multiple processors, hard drives, and network interfaces to ensure that there are backup components available to take over in case of failure. Replication: This involves maintaining multiple copies of critical data or software across different systems or locations.  If one copy becomes unavailable or corrupted, another copy can be used in its place. Error detection and correction: This involves using techniques such as checksums, parity bits, or error-correcting codes to detect and correct errors in data or transmissions.  This can help prevent data corruption or loss caused by hardware or software failures. Graceful degradation: This involves designing a system to continue functioning at a reduced level of performance or capacity in the event of a failure.  This can be useful in situations where complete redundancy is not feasible or cost-effective, such as in mobile devices or cloud computing environments. Load balancing: This involves distributing workloads across multiple systems to prevent any one system from becoming overwhelmed or failing.

"Online games have come a long way since their inception in the late 1970s and early 1980s.  Here is a brief overview of the evolution of online games:Early online games (1970s-1980s): The first online games were text-based and played on university mainframe computers.  These early games, such as Adventure and Dungeon, were played by typing commands and reading text descriptions. Multiplayer games (1990s): In the 1990s, the first online multiplayer games emerged.  Games such as Doom, Quake, and Ultima Online allowed players to connect to servers and play with other players from around the world. Massively multiplayer online games (MMOs) (late 1990s-early 2000s): The late 1990s saw the emergence of massively multiplayer online games, such as EverQuest and World of Warcraft.  These games allowed thousands of players to play in the same virtual world, complete quests, and battle monsters together. Social gaming (mid-2000s): In the mid-2000s, social networking sites such as MySpace and Facebook popularized casual social games such as FarmVille and Mafia Wars.  These games were designed to be played with friends and were often free-to-play with in-app purchases. Mobile games (late 2000s-2010s): With the rise of smartphones and tablets, mobile gaming became increasingly popular.  Games such as Angry Birds, Candy Crush, and Pokémon Go were designed to be played on mobile devices and were often free-to-play with in-app purchases. Esports (2010s): In the 2010s, esports emerged as a popular competitive gaming industry.  Games such as League of Legends and Overwatch became popular esports titles, with professional teams and players competing in tournaments for large prize pools. Overall, the evolution of online games has been driven by advancements in technology and changes in consumer behavior.  Today, online games continue to evolve with the advent of new technologies such as virtual reality and the growing popularity of mobile gaming",1,351,1958,15,149,0.42450142450142453,0.28774928774928776,4.706552706552706,23.4,49.37524191750279,11.324468227424752,13.993400222965441,13.241360182570464,13.538461538461537,0.31054131054131057,0.23035230352303523,0.07859078590785908,0.13821138211382114,0.018970189701897018,0.11924119241192412,0.032520325203252036,27,0.07692307692307693,16,0,7,0,0,0.045584045584045586,0,2

"The simplest and least efficient kind of sort is called the selection sort.  Rather like a bridge player organizing a hand, the selection sort involves finding the record with the lowest key and swapping it with the first record, then scanning back through for the next lowest key and swapping it with the second record, and so on until all the records are sorted.  While this uses memory very efficiently (since the records are sorted in place), it is not only slow, but also gets worse fast.  That is, the time taken to sort n records is proportional to n2. The selection approach suffers because on each pass the sort determines not only the record with the lowest key but 446? ? ? ? sorting and searchingthe one with the next lowest key.  However, that information is not retained.  The heapsort, invented by John Williams in 1964, uses a binary tree to store a heap of sorted records ,.  Once the heap is built, the tree nodes can be used to store record numbers in a corresponding array that will represent the sorted database.  The heapsort is efficient because no records are physically moved, and the only memory needed is for the heap and array.  The heapsort is generally considered the fastest and most reliable general-purpose sorting algorithm, with a maximum running time of log n",0,250,1295,14,119,0.476,0.316,4.248,17.857142857142858,58.30721130221133,10.140368550368553,12.397051597051599,11.741389052700956,9.721621621621622,0.412,0.18076923076923077,0.11538461538461539,0.09615384615384616,0.06538461538461539,0.06923076923076923,0.05384615384615385,5,0.02,13,0,0,0,4,0.068,1,8

"Simulation and visualization are important tools in scientific experiments because they allow scientists to better understand complex systems and phenomena.  Here are some of the key benefits of simulation and visualization in scientific experiments:Understanding complex systems: Many natural and engineered systems are too complex to be understood through direct observation or measurement alone.  By creating computer simulations of these systems, scientists can study how they behave under different conditions and gain insights into their underlying mechanisms. Prediction and hypothesis testing: Simulation and visualization allow scientists to make predictions about how systems will behave in the future and test hypotheses about their behavior.  This can help to guide experimental design and data collection, as well as to refine theories and models. Visualization of data: Visualization techniques are often used to display large and complex datasets in a more intuitive and accessible way.  By creating visual representations of data, scientists can identify patterns and relationships that might be difficult to see through other means. Communication: Simulation and visualization can also be powerful communication tools, allowing scientists to share their findings with a wider audience.  By presenting data and simulations in a visually compelling way, scientists can make their research more accessible and engaging to both experts and the general public. Overall, simulation and visualization are important tools in scientific experiments because they allow researchers to gain a deeper understanding of complex systems, test hypotheses, and communicate their findings in a more compelling way.",1,265,1712,10,126,0.47547169811320755,0.30566037735849055,5.535849056603774,26.5,9.663126556016636,17.8986265560166,20.926307053941912,18.669449996058646,17.72365145228215,0.37735849056603776,0.2740740740740741,0.10740740740740741,0.10740740740740741,0.04814814814814815,0.09259259259259259,0.05555555555555555,0,0.0,8,0,5,0,0,0.03018867924528302,0,1

"In object-oriented programming, inheritance is a mechanism that allows a new class to be based on an existing class, inheriting its properties and methods.  To illustrate this concept with an example, we can use the Microsoft Windows Dialog Box. A dialog box is a graphical user interface element that displays information to the user and prompts them for a response.  In Microsoft Windows, a dialog box is implemented as a class, which we can call the DialogBox class. Now, let's suppose we want to create a new type of dialog box called a ColorPickerDialogBox that allows the user to pick a color.  We can use inheritance to create this new class based on the DialogBox class. The ColorPickerDialogBox class will inherit all the properties and methods of the DialogBox class, such as the ability to display text, buttons, and input fields.  However, the ColorPickerDialogBox class will also have its own unique properties and methods that are specific to picking colors, such as a color palette and color preview box. By using inheritance, we can avoid duplicating code and make our program more efficient and easier to maintain.  We can also create more specialized classes that build upon existing classes, making our code more modular and extensible.",1,230,1255,10,104,0.45217391304347826,0.26956521739130435,4.543478260869565,23.0,42.18813592233013,12.492543689320389,16.006990291262138,14.696529576185021,11.48155339805825,0.4043478260869565,0.22784810126582278,0.14345991561181434,0.05907172995780591,0.029535864978902954,0.05907172995780591,0.05063291139240506,5,0.021739130434782608,13,0,0,0,0,0.05652173913043478,1,1

"An  applet  is  a  small  program  that  uses  the  resources  of  a larger program and usually provides customization or addi-tional  features.   The  term  first  appeared  in  the  early  1990s in  connection  with  Apple’s  AppleScript  scripting  language for the macintosh operating system.  Today Java applets rep-resent the most widespread use of this idea in Web develop-ment ,. Java  applets  are  compiled  to  an  intermediate  repre-sentation  called  bytecode,  and  generally  are  run  in  a  Web browser  ,.   Applets  thus  represent  one of  several  alternatives  for  interacting  with  users  of  Web pages  beyond  what  can  be  accomplished  using  simple  text markup  ,. An  applet  can  be  invoked  by  inserting  a  reference  to its  program  code  in  the  text  of  the  Web  page,  using  the HTmL applet element or the now-preferred object element.  Although  the  distinction  between  applets  and  scripting code  (such  as  in  PHP)  is  somewhat  vague,  applets  usually run  in  their  own  window  or  otherwise  provide  their  own interface,  while  scripting  code  is  generally  used  to  tailor the  behavior  of  separately  created  objects.   Applets  are  also rather  like  plug-ins,  but  the  latter  are  generally  used  to provide  a  particular  capability  (such  as  the  ability  to  read or  play  a  particular  kind  of  media  file),  and  have  a  stan-dardized facility for their installation and management ,. Some  common  uses  for  applets  include  animations  of scientific or programming concepts for Web pages support-ing  class  curricula  and  for  games  designed  to  be  played using  Web  browsers.   Animation  tools  such  as  Flash  and Shockwave are often used for creating graphic applets. To  prevent  badly  or  maliciously  written  applets  from affecting  user  files,  applets  such  as  Java  applets  are  gen-erally  run  within  a  restricted  or  “sandbox”  environment where, for example, they are not allowed to write or change files on disk.",0,322,2043,11,175,0.5434782608695652,0.4161490683229814,4.795031055900621,29.272727272727273,33.04694357366773,15.199404388714733,17.71786833855799,15.786528217884907,13.157241379310342,0.36335403726708076,0.17190388170055454,0.07393715341959335,0.04251386321626617,0.03512014787430684,0.06839186691312385,0.029574861367837338,14,0.043478260869565216,13,0,0,0,0,0.040372670807453416,1,3

"A Certification Authority (CA) is a trusted entity that issues digital certificates to verify the identity of individuals, organizations, or other entities.  A digital certificate is a form of electronic identification that contains information about the identity of the certificate holder, including their public key, which can be used to encrypt and decrypt messages. CAs are responsible for verifying the identity of certificate holders and issuing certificates that are trusted by other entities in the digital ecosystem.  This helps to establish secure communications between parties and ensure the integrity and confidentiality of data transmitted over the internet. CAs operate under a hierarchical structure, with root CAs at the top of the hierarchy and subordinate CAs below them.  Root CAs issue certificates to subordinate CAs, which can then issue certificates to end-users.  This structure ensures that trust is maintained throughout the digital ecosystem and that certificates are only issued to trusted parties.",1,166,1027,7,90,0.5421686746987951,0.3795180722891566,5.259036144578313,23.714285714285715,11.257880794702004,17.04802270577105,20.549101229895935,17.613555460941566,15.745695364238408,0.40963855421686746,0.27906976744186046,0.12209302325581395,0.0755813953488372,0.011627906976744186,0.11046511627906977,0.05232558139534884,2,0.012048192771084338,6,0,0,0,0,0.03614457831325301,0,0

"Growing concern about spyware has prompted the use of antispyware programs such as Ad-Aware and Spybot-Search & Destroy, as well as a free program from Microsoft.  Antispyware programs are also being included in popular security suites from companies such as Symantec and McAfee.  The programs work similarly to antivirus programs, watching for suspicious behavior or “signatures” matching known spyware or adware.  Depending on the program, the spyware can be blocked from executing at all or removed from the system. The software varies considerably in effectiveness, so users may have to run several different programs to completely remove an “infestation. ”Spyware has been generally given a lower priority than viruses or even spam.  When challenged, spyware makers generally claim that the user authorized its installation (at least implicitly) by installing the utility or other software that contains it.  Although antispyware legislation has been introduced in Congress, it has not passed as of mid-2008.  However, state officials such as former New York State Attorney General Eliot Spitzer successfully sued a spyware company, winning a $7. 5 million settlement",0,200,1172,10,131,0.655,0.525,4.955,20.0,33.89192857142859,12.879571428571431,15.228571428571428,14.696529576185021,14.425142857142855,0.345,0.21904761904761905,0.11428571428571428,0.05714285714285714,0.06666666666666667,0.09523809523809523,0.05714285714285714,12,0.06,8,0,0,0,0,0.04,1,3
"Code generation is the process of converting the high-level source code written in a programming language into low-level machine code that can be executed by a computer.  The code generation process is typically the final stage of the compilation process, following lexical analysis, syntax analysis, and semantic analysis. The process of code generation can be divided into several steps:Intermediate Representation: The compiler typically converts the source code into an intermediate representation (IR) that is easier to analyze and optimize than the original source code. Instruction Selection: The compiler selects the appropriate machine instructions to implement each operation in the IR.  This involves mapping high-level operations to the corresponding low-level instructions, such as adding two numbers or loading data from memory. Register Allocation: The compiler assigns registers to hold intermediate values and computations.  This involves minimizing the number of register accesses and maximizing the reuse of registers to improve performance. Instruction Scheduling: The compiler reorders the instructions to optimize performance, taking into account factors such as data dependencies and instruction latencies. Code Emission: The compiler generates the final machine code by emitting the selected instructions and associated data. Optimization: The compiler may perform additional optimizations on the generated code to improve its performance or reduce its size.  This may involve removing redundant code, reordering instructions, or replacing code with more efficient alternatives.",1,249,1602,11,121,0.4859437751004016,0.3092369477911647,5.534136546184739,22.636363636363637,9.969424105306445,16.859934183463597,22.33500617030029,18.535231010973284,18.07782805429864,0.3172690763052209,0.3065134099616858,0.13026819923371646,0.08045977011494253,0.011494252873563218,0.07662835249042145,0.034482758620689655,3,0.012048192771084338,7,0,7,0,0,0.028112449799196786,0,0
"There are several trends in recent years that have changed the emphasis in scheduling algorithms.  Two of the most significant trends are:Multi-core and many-core processors: Modern computer systems often have multiple cores, which means that there are several processors on a single chip.  This trend has led to an increased emphasis on parallel processing and scheduling algorithms that can take advantage of the parallelism offered by multiple cores. Cloud computing: Cloud computing has become increasingly popular, and it allows users to access computing resources on demand.  This trend has led to an increased emphasis on scheduling algorithms that can handle dynamic workloads, where the number of users and the demand for computing resources can vary over time. As a result of these trends, scheduling algorithms have evolved to become more complex and sophisticated.  Many modern scheduling algorithms are designed to take advantage of parallel processing and dynamic workloads, while still ensuring that tasks are completed efficiently and effectively.  Some examples of these algorithms include gang scheduling, space-sharing scheduling, and adaptive scheduling.",1,190,1174,8,94,0.49473684210526314,0.26842105263157895,5.257894736842105,23.75,28.802532894736856,14.552097953216375,20.01198830409357,17.267425705330172,15.987134502923976,0.3684210526315789,0.26865671641791045,0.12437810945273632,0.1044776119402985,0.03482587064676617,0.08955223880597014,0.05970149253731343,2,0.010526315789473684,7,0,3,0,0,0.03684210526315789,0,0

"The idea of networks has been around for centuries, as people have always sought ways to connect with each other over long distances.  However, the modern computer network as we know it today began to take shape in the mid-20th century. In the 1950s, computers were large, expensive, and rare machines that were primarily used by governments, large corporations, and academic institutions.  These computers were often housed in large rooms or buildings and were operated by trained technicians. One of the earliest computer networks was the SAGE (Semi-Automatic Ground Environment) system, which was developed in the late 1950s by the United States Air Force.  The SAGE system was designed to provide early warning of potential air attacks by the Soviet Union.  It used a network of interconnected computers to track incoming enemy aircraft and coordinate defensive responses. In the 1960s, the US Department of Defense developed the ARPANET, which was the first wide-area network to use packet switching.  The ARPANET was initially designed as a way for researchers at different universities and research institutions to share computing resources and collaborate on research projects. Over the years, computer networks evolved and became more sophisticated, eventually leading to the creation of the World Wide Web in the 1990s.  Today, networks are an essential part of our daily lives, connecting people and devices all over the world and enabling us to access information and services instantly from almost anywhere.",1,263,1520,11,151,0.5741444866920152,0.44106463878326996,4.863117870722434,23.90909090909091,36.291687211094,13.527272727272727,16.886902927580895,15.903189008614273,13.51610169491526,0.3650190114068441,0.2271062271062271,0.0989010989010989,0.08424908424908426,0.04395604395604396,0.0989010989010989,0.047619047619047616,19,0.07224334600760456,14,0,0,0,0,0.053231939163498096,1,1

"Hashing has many applications in computer science, but two major ones are:Data Storage and Retrieval: Hashing is used for efficient data storage and retrieval in many applications.  Hash tables are widely used data structures that store data in a way that allows for fast lookups, insertions, and deletions.  In a hash table, data elements are stored based on their keys, and a hash function is used to map the keys to an index in an array.  This makes it easy to quickly access a data element given its key, and the time complexity of basic operations like insertions and lookups is typically O(1) on average. Data Authentication and Verification: Hashing is also used for data authentication and verification.  When a hash function is applied to a message or data file, it generates a fixed-length hash value that is unique to the input data.  This makes it possible to verify that the data has not been tampered with or corrupted in any way, as any changes to the input data will result in a different hash value.  Hashing is widely used for password storage, where passwords are hashed and stored in a database, and for digital signatures, where a hash of a document or message is signed to ensure its authenticity and integrity.",1,238,1233,8,110,0.46218487394957986,0.2815126050420168,4.26890756302521,29.75,42.26297169811323,13.947830188679248,16.07169811320755,14.37465228746014,10.195283018867922,0.39915966386554624,0.27459016393442626,0.11475409836065574,0.05327868852459016,0.020491803278688523,0.0942622950819672,0.06147540983606557,3,0.012605042016806723,11,0,3,0,0,0.046218487394957986,0,2
"RSS, or Really Simple Syndication, was developed in the late 1990s as a way to easily distribute content from websites to other sites or individuals.  The first version of RSS was created by Netscape in 1999, but it was later refined and standardized by Dave Winer and others at UserLand Software. In 2002, RSS 2. 0 was released, which became the most widely adopted version of the format.  RSS 2. 0 introduced new features such as support for enclosures (which allowed podcasts and other media to be distributed through RSS), and improved support for metadata and internationalization. In the mid-2000s, RSS became increasingly popular as a way to follow blogs and news sites.  Many popular blogging platforms, such as WordPress and TypePad, included built-in support for RSS feeds, making it easy for users to subscribe to updates.  RSS readers and feed aggregators such as Feedly and Google Reader also gained popularity during this time. However, the popularity of RSS declined in the late 2000s and early 2010s as social media and other content distribution channels such as email newsletters became more popular.

Disk Cache is a temporary storage place that a computer can use to storea file after reading it from the hard drive.  For instance‚ telling a computerto open a MP3 file‚ it may take several seconds for it to locate and read thefile into memory from the PCs hard drive.  However‚ if the computer storesthe file in the Disk Cache‚ the next time one wishes to open the same file‚data can be retrieved from the disk cache rather than loading it from the harddrive. One definition refers to a Disk Cache specifically as: hard disk-based memory used to store accessed web pages.  This technique enables the browserload the stored pages from the cache rather than from the network.  That iswhy clicking the ‘Back’ button on a browser usually retrieves a page nearlyinstantaneously.  The virtual memory system that comes with Microsoft Windows is also another example of disk caching to increase performance,0,160,899,7,99,0.61875,0.48125,4.65,22.857142857142858,54.39827814569537,11.030804162724696,13.131882686849577,12.540900571622839,10.829139072847681,0.375,0.22807017543859648,0.14035087719298245,0.04678362573099415,0.05263157894736842,0.09941520467836257,0.03508771929824561,8,0.05,0,0,1,0,0,0.0,1,2

"Software development generally follows a standard process, which can be summarized in the following steps:Requirements Gathering: This is the initial stage of software development, where the requirements for the software are collected from stakeholders, users, and business analysts. Analysis and Design: The gathered requirements are analyzed and the system architecture is designed.  The design is documented in the form of diagrams, flowcharts, or other models. Implementation: The software is developed based on the design using a programming language and development tools. Testing: Once the software is developed, it is tested to ensure that it meets the requirements and works as intended.  Testing may include unit testing, integration testing, and system testing. Deployment: After testing, the software is deployed to the production environment or to the end-users. Maintenance: After the software is deployed, it may require maintenance to fix any bugs or issues that are discovered, as well as to add new features or enhancements. These steps may be iterative, with the development team going back and forth between steps as necessary to refine the software and ensure that it meets the needs of the users and stakeholders.",1,217,1235,9,101,0.46543778801843316,0.31797235023041476,4.824884792626728,24.11111111111111,37.80865715983364,13.147557932263819,16.439453357100415,15.021129683784007,14.318716577540108,0.391705069124424,0.2850678733031674,0.12217194570135746,0.03167420814479638,0.027149321266968326,0.06334841628959276,0.07692307692307693,1,0.004608294930875576,13,0,7,0,0,0.059907834101382486,0,0

BBSes were often run by individuals or small groups of enthusiasts and were tailored to specific communities, such as hobbyists, gamers, or hackers.  They offered a platform for users to share their interests, knowledge, and experiences, and were often characterized by a sense of community and camaraderie.

"In the early 1950s, knowledge of computing tended to have and hoc nature.  On the practical level, computing staffs tended to train newcomers in the specific hardware and machine-level programming languages in use at a particular site.  On the theoretical level, programmers in scientific fields were likely to come from a background in electronics, electrical engineering, or similar disciplines. As it became clear that computers were going to play an increasingly important role, courses specific to computing were added to curricula in mathematics and engineering.  By the late 1950s, however, leading people in the computing field had become convinced that a formal curriculum in computer science was necessary for further advance in an increasingly sophisticated computing arena .  By the early 1960s, efforts at the University of Michigan, University of Houston, Stanford, and other institutions had resulted in the creation of separate graduate departments of computer science.  By the mid-1960s, the National Academy of Sciences and the President’s Science Advisory Committee had both called for a major expansion of efforts in computer science education to be aided by federal funding.  During the 1970s and 1980s, mathematical and engineering societies (in particular the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM) and Institute for Electrical and Electronic Engineering (IEEE) worked to established detailed computer science curricula that extended to undergraduate study.

"A compiler is a program that takes as input a program written in a source language and produces as output an equivalent program written in another (target) language.  Usually the input program is in a high-level language such as C++ and the output is in assembly language for the target machine ,. Compilers are useful because programming directly in low-level machine instructions (as had to be done with the first computers) is tedious and prone to errors.  Use of assembly language helps somewhat by allowing substitution of symbols (variable names) for memory locations and the use of mnemonic names for operations (such as “add for addition, rather than some binary instruction code).  An assembler is essentially a compiler that needs to make only relatively simple translations, because assembly language is still at a relatively low level.",0,152,847,5,84,0.5526315789473685,0.3618421052631579,4.6644736842105265,30.4,31.53666666666669,15.56814814814815,19.68888888888889,17.353723509956247,12.662222222222226,0.3881578947368421,0.27672955974842767,0.06918238993710692,0.0880503144654088,0.05660377358490566,0.1320754716981132,0.05660377358490566,2,0.013157894736842105,3,0,0,0,0,0.019736842105263157,0,2

"File sharing refers to the process of making files available to other users over a network or the internet.  This can be done in a variety of ways, including through a file server, email attachment, cloud storage service, or peer-to-peer (P2P) network. A peer-to-peer (P2P) network is a type of network where computers or devices communicate directly with each other, rather than through a central server.  P2P networks are commonly used for file sharing, as they allow users to share files with others without the need for a central file server.  In a P2P network, each user's computer acts as both a client and a server, enabling files to be shared directly between users. In a P2P file sharing network, users can search for and download files from other users who have made those files available for sharing.  Examples of popular P2P file sharing networks include BitTorrent, eDonkey, and Gnutella.

"A web server is a software program that runs on a computer and is responsible for serving web content to clients, typically web browsers.  The working of a web server can be explained in the following steps:A client (a web browser) sends a request to the web server for a particular web page or resource, using the HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) protocol.  The request typically contains information such as the type of resource requested, the desired encoding, and any other relevant data. The web server receives the request and analyzes it to determine which resource is being requested, and if it is available on the server.  If the resource is not found, the web server will send a ""404 Not Found"" response to the client. If the resource is found, the web server retrieves it and prepares to send it to the client.  This may involve reading the resource from disk, generating it dynamically using server-side scripting languages like PHP, or retrieving it from a database. The web server sends the resource to the client in the form of an HTTP response.  The response typically includes headers that provide metadata about the resource, such as its content type, length, and encoding. The client receives the response and renders the resource to the user, typically by displaying it in a web browser. Throughout this process, the web server may interact with other servers, databases, or services to fulfill the client's request.  For example, the web server might use a load balancer to distribute requests across multiple servers, or it might authenticate the client's identity using a separate authentication server. Overall, the web server acts as a middleman between the client and the resources it is requesting, handling the low-level details of communication and data transfer to ensure that the client receives the correct content in a timely and efficient manner.",1,352,1882,13,141,0.4005681818181818,0.26420454545454547,4.4602272727272725,27.076923076923077,43.8995220313667,13.041165048543693,15.074035349763506,13.757784519515319,11.560517799352748,0.38920454545454547,0.281767955801105,0.11602209944751381,0.04143646408839779,0.016574585635359115,0.0856353591160221,0.04143646408839779,2,0.005681818181818182,20,0,1,0,0,0.056818181818181816,0,4
"Self-driving cars make decisions by combining data from sensors, cameras, radar, and lidar to understand their surroundings and navigate safely. These vehicles use advanced algorithms, including machine learning and deep learning models, to interpret the environment—identifying objects like pedestrians, other vehicles, road signs, and lane markings. Based on this real-time information, the car’s onboard system predicts the behavior of nearby objects and plans its next actions, such as when to change lanes, brake, or accelerate. The decision-making process balances multiple factors, including safety, efficiency, and traffic laws, allowing the car to respond quickly and appropriately to complex driving situations.

"The history of graphics cards can be traced back to the 1970s, when computer graphics were first being developed.  In the early days, graphics were generated by the computer's central processing unit (CPU), which limited the quality and speed of graphics rendering. The first dedicated graphics card was developed in the late 1970s by IBM, which introduced the Monochrome Display Adapter (MDA) in 1981.  The MDA was a text-only display adapter that could display up to 80 columns of text on a monochrome monitor. In the early 1980s, the Color Graphics Adapter (CGA) was introduced, which was the first graphics card to support color graphics.  The CGA could display 16 colors at a resolution of 320x200 pixels. In the mid-1980s, the Enhanced Graphics Adapter (EGA) was introduced, which could display up to 16 colors at a higher resolution of 640x350 pixels. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, a number of new graphics standards were introduced, including Video Graphics Array (VGA), Super VGA (SVGA), and XGA.  These standards offered higher resolutions, more colors, and faster refresh rates, and helped to drive the development of dedicated graphics cards. In the mid-1990s, 3D graphics technology began to emerge, with the introduction of the first 3D graphics accelerators.  These cards, such as the 3dfx Voodoo and the Nvidia RIVA, were designed to offload 3D rendering tasks from the CPU, resulting in smoother and more realistic graphics.",1,276,1446,11,115,0.4166666666666667,0.2463768115942029,4.380434782608695,25.09090909090909,50.265926648458844,11.510394069449866,14.4813109637144,13.463846863241148,11.727896995708154,0.32971014492753625,0.20774647887323944,0.08098591549295775,0.08450704225352113,0.01056338028169014,0.09859154929577464,0.0528169014084507,36,0.13043478260869565,20,0,0,0,0,0.07246376811594203,0,3

"By the 1990s, PC users generally used tapes only for making backups.  A typical backup tape drive uses DAT (digital audio tape) cartridges that hold from hundreds of megabytes to several gigabytes of data.  Most drives use a rotating assembly of four heads (two read and two write) that verify data as it’s being written.  As a backup medium, tape has a lower cost per gigabyte than disk devices.  It is easy to use and can be set up to run unattended (except for periodically changing cartridges). However, since tapes are written and read sequentially, they are not convenient for restoring selected files ,.  Many smaller installations now prefer using a second (“mirror”) hard drive as backup, using disk arrays , or using recordable CDs or optical drives for smaller amounts of data ,. Many large companies and government agencies have thousands of reels of tape stored away in their vaults since the 1960s, including data returned from early NASA space missions.  As time passes, it becomes increasingly difficult to guarantee that this archived data can be successfully read.

"In computing, distributed services refer to a model of providing services or applications that are spread across multiple networked computers, often referred to as nodes.  The purpose of this model is to increase scalability, fault tolerance, and flexibility of the service or application. Distributed services allow a system to provide services to its users even if some of the nodes in the system fail.  They also provide a way to scale up or down the system's capacity by adding or removing nodes as needed.  This can be particularly useful for applications that require high availability or that need to process large amounts of data. Some examples of distributed services include:Distributed file systems: These systems provide a way to store and access files across multiple networked computers.  Examples include Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS) and GlusterFS. Distributed databases: These databases are spread across multiple nodes and allow for the storage and retrieval of large amounts of data.  Examples include Apache Cassandra and MongoDB. Distributed computing frameworks: These frameworks provide a way to distribute computing tasks across multiple nodes in order to speed up processing.  Examples include Apache Spark and Apache Hadoop. Distributed messaging systems: These systems provide a way for nodes in a distributed system to communicate with each other.  Examples include Apache Kafka and RabbitMQ. Distributed web services: These services allow for the distribution of web-based applications across multiple nodes.  Examples include Amazon Web Services (AWS) Elastic Load Balancing (ELB) and Microsoft Azure Load Balancer.

"e-Government is the public’s efforts to bring dealings with the governmentonline, thereby enabling citizens to conduct most of their businesses (e. g. ,ordering a passport) online.  Accordingly, while the UK wants every government transaction to be offered online by 2005, Denmark has chosen toprovide all of its citizens with digital signatures to enable them to do all theirtransactions online ,. Pushing e-Government initiatives requires satisfactory IT security of information, data and protection of people’s privacy which can be a challenge. For instance in 2002, Canada’s Auditor General released a report in which itstated that government sites do not seem to do well as far as privacy and datasecurity are concerned.  His 2003 report acknowledged some improvementsbut did not yet give e-Government sites a passing grade.  Quite likely, othergovernments may have to improve on this score as well. As Table 9 suggests, putting down a policy about e-government and ITinitiatives is important.  The hard work follows thereafter.  Providing everycitizen with a digital signature is a start but, without addressing the issuesin Table 9, it is unlikely to improve service for citizens.

"By default, once information is digitized it is simply a pattern of bits that can be easily copied within the same or a different medium, using a variety of software or the built-in facilities of the operating system.  Of course the development of tape-recording technology in the mid-20th century already made it possible to copy audio recordings, and the later development of videotape and the VCR did the same for video.  However, while analog copying techniques lose some accuracy (or fidelity) with each generation of copying, digital files can be copied exactly each time.  It is equally easy to e-mail, upload, or otherwise distribute audio or video files. Legally, the creator of an original work can assert copyright—literally, the “right to copy” or to control when and how the work is distributed.  Digital rights management (DRM) refers to a variety of technologies that can be used to enforce this right by making it at least difficult for the purchaser of one copy of a work to copy and distribute it in turn.

"Emulation refers to the process of simulating the behavior of one computer system on another computer system.  The purpose of emulation is to allow software or hardware designed for one system to run on a different system, typically with different hardware or software configurations.  To emulate a system, software known as an emulator must be installed on the host system.  The emulator simulates the behavior of the original hardware or software platform, allowing the system to run software designed for the original platform. Emulation can be resource-intensive, as the host system must dedicate significant processing power and memory resources to simulating the behavior of the emulated system.  As a result, emulation may not always be feasible for more complex systems or applications.

"The Data Encryption Standard (DES) is a symmetric-key encryption algorithm that was widely used to protect data confidentiality in electronic communication and storage systems in the 1970s and 1980s. The DES algorithm works by using a single secret key to encrypt and decrypt data.  The key is used to perform a series of mathematical operations on the plaintext to produce the ciphertext, and the same key is used to reverse the operations and recover the plaintext from the ciphertext.  The key size for DES is 56 bits, and the algorithm uses a block cipher with a fixed block size of 64 bits. Although DES was considered a secure encryption standard for many years, advances in computing power and cryptographic attacks eventually rendered the algorithm vulnerable to brute-force attacks.  As a result, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) was adopted as a replacement for DES in the early 2000s.  Despite its obsolescence, DES still remains in use in some legacy systems and applications.",1,177,994,7,90,0.5084745762711864,0.3446327683615819,4.6892655367231635,25.285714285714285,37.41049689440996,13.755155279503104,16.40496894409938,14.756829357015494,12.165217391304349,0.3672316384180791,0.22162162162162163,0.0972972972972973,0.08108108108108109,0.016216216216216217,0.10270270270270271,0.03783783783783784,9,0.05084745762711865,5,0,0,0,0,0.02824858757062147,0,0
"In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based data structure that is used to efficiently maintain a collection of elements where the priority of each element is determined by its value or some other key. Heaps can be of two types:Max heap: In a max heap, the parent nodes are always greater than or equal to their child nodes.  The maximum element in the heap is always the root node. Min heap: In a min heap, the parent nodes are always smaller than or equal to their child nodes.  The minimum element in the heap is always the root node. A heap is often used in algorithms such as sorting, graph algorithms, and priority queue implementations. The most common operation performed on a heap is insertion, where a new element is added to the heap in a way that maintains the heap property.  The next most common operation is deletion, where the root node is removed from the heap and replaced with another element in a way that also maintains the heap property.  Other common operations on a heap include searching for an element, merging two heaps, and extracting the maximum or minimum element. Heaps have an average time complexity of O(log n) for both insertion and deletion, making them a popular choice for a wide range of applications where efficient and fast access to elements is required.",1,256,1308,10,111,0.43359375,0.25,4.203125,25.6,51.334731441048035,11.788161572052406,16.14689956331878,14.696529576185021,9.501310043668123,0.4140625,0.2923076923076923,0.06923076923076923,0.08846153846153847,0.03076923076923077,0.1076923076923077,0.057692307692307696,5,0.01953125,10,0,3,0,0,0.0390625,0,9

"Typography was computerized through the development of digital typefaces and the creation of software that allowed users to manipulate and design text on a computer. The process of digitizing typography began in the 1950s with the development of the first computer fonts.  These were initially created as bitmap images, where each letter was represented by a grid of pixels.  As technology advanced, more sophisticated font formats were developed, such as PostScript and TrueType, which allowed for scalable and high-quality typography. In the 1980s and 1990s, software such as Adobe Illustrator, Adobe Photoshop, and QuarkXPress made it possible for designers to create and manipulate typography on a computer.  These programs allowed users to select fonts, adjust kerning and tracking, and create layouts with precision.

Improved performance: Client-server architecture can improve performance by allowing the server to handle complex and resource-intensive tasks, freeing up client resources for other tasks. Improved maintenance and support: Client-server architecture simplifies maintenance and support, as software and data can be centrally managed, updated, and backed up. Platform independence: The client-server model enables platform independence, which means that clients can access the server regardless of the operating system or hardware platform they are running on.",1,182,1158,6,92,0.5054945054945055,0.3076923076923077,5.5054945054945055,30.333333333333332,15.925514861995765,17.53856687898089,19.638641188959664,17.122413403193683,18.940127388535036,0.3241758241758242,0.35714285714285715,0.11224489795918367,0.07142857142857142,0.01020408163265306,0.08163265306122448,0.05102040816326531,0,0.0,11,0,7,0,0,0.06043956043956044,0,0
"Electronic mail is perhaps the most ubiquitous computer application in use today.  E-mail can be defined as the sending of a message to one or more individuals via a computer system, open the file, and look for messages.  In 1971, however, the ARPANET (ancestor of the Internet—see internet) was used by researchers at Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN) to send messages from a user at one computer to a user at another.  The availability of e-mail helped fuel the growth of the ARPANET through the 1970s and beyond. connection. Development and ArchitectureThe simplest form of e-mail began in the 1960s as a way that users on a time-sharing computer system could post and read messages.

"The resolution of a scanner depends on the number of pixels into which it can break the image.  The color depth depends on how many bits of information that it can store per pixel (more information means more gradations of color or gray).  Resolutions of 2,400 dots per inch (dpi) or more are now common, with up to 36 bit color depth, allowing for about 68. 7 billion colors or gradations ,Besides considerations of resolution and color depth, the quality of a scanned image depends on the quality of the scanner’s optics as well as on how the page or other object reflects light.

"In computer science, a Demilitarized Zone (DMZ) is a network segment that is isolated from the internal network and is exposed to the public internet.  The purpose of a DMZ is to provide a secure location for servers and services that need to be accessible from the internet, such as web servers, email servers, and file transfer servers, while protecting the internal network from external threats. A DMZ is typically implemented by placing a firewall or a router between the internal network and the DMZ.  The firewall is configured to allow traffic from the internet to the DMZ while blocking traffic to the internal network.  This allows external users to access services in the DMZ, while protecting the internal network from attacks that may originate from the internet. However, it's important to note that a DMZ is not a completely secure solution and does not provide full protection against all types of attacks.  Additional security measures such as intrusion detection and prevention systems, strong authentication, and access control policies should be implemented to ensure the security of the DMZ and the internal network.",1,202,1137,7,91,0.4504950495049505,0.29207920792079206,4.707920792079208,28.857142857142858,27.28032786885248,15.94888368462139,20.29320843091335,17.931933174767593,12.606557377049185,0.42574257425742573,0.23786407766990292,0.08737864077669903,0.08737864077669903,0.014563106796116505,0.0970873786407767,0.06310679611650485,8,0.039603960396039604,9,0,0,0,0,0.04455445544554455,1,6

"Reverse engineering is the process of analyzing a product, device, or system to understand how it was designed and how it works.  It involves taking apart the object and examining its components and behavior to determine its structure, function, and operation.  The goal of reverse engineering is to gain insights into how a product or system works in order to replicate, modify, or improve upon it. Reverse engineering is often used in the fields of engineering, computer science, and manufacturing.  In engineering, reverse engineering can be used to understand the design of a product or system that was created by another engineer or company.  This can be useful in the development of new products or in troubleshooting existing ones. In computer science, reverse engineering can be used to analyze software programs to determine their source code, structure, and behavior.  This can be useful for understanding how a program works or for detecting and fixing security vulnerabilities. In manufacturing, reverse engineering can be used to create a duplicate or modified version of a product or component.  This can be useful in cases where the original design or manufacturing process is no longer available or is too expensive to reproduce. However, it's important to note that reverse engineering can be a controversial practice, especially when it involves proprietary or confidential information.  It's important to follow ethical guidelines and legal regulations when performing reverse engineering.",1,261,1508,12,111,0.42528735632183906,0.27586206896551724,4.865900383141763,21.75,29.680632183908074,13.922413793103448,16.1816091954023,15.579741850924794,13.69396551724138,0.41379310344827586,0.22388059701492538,0.12686567164179105,0.08582089552238806,0.022388059701492536,0.0708955223880597,0.08582089552238806,0,0.0,15,0,0,0,0,0.05747126436781609,1,5

"Early voting is a type of voting system that allows eligible voters to cast their ballots before the scheduled election day.  Early voting typically takes place in the days or weeks leading up to the election day, and is usually conducted at designated polling places or through mail-in ballots. Early voting systems vary depending on the location and jurisdiction.  In some cases, voters may be required to provide a valid reason for why they cannot vote on election day, such as work or travel obligations.  In other cases, early voting is available to all registered voters regardless of the reason. Early voting can offer several advantages, such as increased convenience and accessibility for voters who may have difficulty making it to the polls on election day due to work or personal commitments.  It can also help to reduce long lines and wait times at polling places on election day, which can lead to greater voter turnout and participation. Early voting systems can also pose some challenges, such as the need for additional polling places and staff to manage the early voting process, which can increase costs for local jurisdictions.

"Anyone who has seen computers in old movies is familiar with the row of large, freestanding tape cabinets with their spinning reels of tape.  The visual cue that the computer was running consisted of the reels thrashing back and forth vigorously while rows of lights flashed on the computer console.  Magnetic tape was indeed the mainstay for data storage in most large computers , in the 1950s through the 1970s. In early mainframes the main memory (corresponding to today’s RAM chips) consisted of “core”—thousands of tiny magnetized rings crisscrossed with wires by which they could be set or read.  Because core memory was limited to a few thousand bytes (kB), it was used only to hold the program instructions , and to store temporary working data while the program was running. The source data to be processed by the program was read from a reel of tape on the drive.

"Firewalls serve several important functions in computer networks, including:Traffic filtering: Firewalls can be configured to block or allow incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predefined rules.  This allows the firewall to filter out unwanted or malicious traffic, such as viruses, malware, spam, and unauthorized access attempts. Access control: Firewalls can control access to network resources by allowing or denying traffic based on user identity, network location, time of day, or other factors.  This helps to ensure that only authorized users can access sensitive data or resources. Network address translation (NAT): Firewalls can perform NAT, which allows multiple devices on a private network to share a single public IP address.  This provides an additional layer of security by hiding the internal IP addresses from the internet. Logging and auditing: Firewalls can log network traffic and generate reports on network activity, including attempted attacks and unauthorized access attempts.  This information can be used for troubleshooting, monitoring, and compliance purposes.

"RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) is a technology that uses radio waves to wirelessly transmit data from a tag or label attached to an object to a reader.  RFID technology can be classified into two types: passive RFID and active RFID. Passive RFID tags or labels do not have their own power source and rely on the power transmitted from the RFID reader to send their information.  When the RFID reader emits a signal, the passive RFID tag or label receives the signal and uses the power to transmit its information back to the reader.  Passive RFID tags are typically used for tracking inventory, managing supply chains, and tracking assets. Active RFID tags or labels, on the other hand, have their own power source and can transmit data independently of an RFID reader.  These tags use batteries or other power sources to broadcast a signal to the reader.  Active RFID tags are often used for tracking high-value assets, such as shipping containers or vehicles, or for tracking people in environments like hospitals or warehouses. The main differences between passive and active RFID are their power requirements and the range over which they can operate.  Passive RFID tags are cheaper, smaller, and have a shorter read range than active RFID tags.  Active RFID tags are more expensive, larger, and can have a longer read range.  The choice between passive and active RFID depends on the application and the requirements of the specific use case.",1,268,1454,12,112,0.417910447761194,0.2574626865671642,4.496268656716418,22.333333333333332,52.823684573002765,10.901446280991738,12.52947658402204,12.009924989830619,10.96528925619835,0.376865671641791,0.2697841726618705,0.10071942446043165,0.09712230215827339,0.025179856115107913,0.07913669064748201,0.04316546762589928,12,0.04477611940298507,11,0,1,0,0,0.041044776119402986,0,4
"A codec (short for coder-decoder) is a technology used to compress and decompress digital media such as audio and video.  The purpose of a codec is to reduce the file size of digital media without significantly degrading its quality. There are two types of codecs: lossy and lossless.  Lossy codecs are designed to reduce file size by discarding some of the original data, resulting in a smaller file but a loss of quality.  Lossless codecs, on the other hand, compress the data without discarding any of it, resulting in a smaller file but no loss of quality. Codecs are used in a variety of applications, such as streaming media over the internet, video conferencing, and recording and playing back digital media.  Some examples of popular codecs include H. 264 for video and MP3 for audio. In order for digital media to be played back or edited, the appropriate codec must be installed on the computer or device.

To use FTP, users need an FTP client program, which can connect to an FTP server using a username and password, and then transfer files using commands such as upload, download, delete, or rename. FTP is commonly used for website maintenance, software distribution, and large file transfers, and it is supported by most operating systems and web browsers.  However, FTP is not a secure protocol, and data transferred over FTP is not encrypted, which can make it vulnerable to interception or modification by unauthorized parties.  For this reason, more secure protocols such as SFTP (Secure File Transfer Protocol) or FTPS (FTP over SSL) are often used instead of plain FTP.",1,178,929,6,91,0.5112359550561798,0.33146067415730335,4.348314606741573,29.666666666666668,46.58779411764709,13.096176470588237,14.905882352941177,13.295006501635747,11.432679738562094,0.34269662921348315,0.22099447513812154,0.09944751381215469,0.08287292817679558,0.03314917127071823,0.09392265193370165,0.04419889502762431,13,0.07303370786516854,15,0,0,0,0,0.08426966292134831,1,4
"A Storage Area Network (SAN) is a dedicated high-speed network that provides block-level access to data storage.  In a SAN, storage devices such as disk arrays, tape libraries, and other storage appliances are connected to servers through a series of switches and/or hubs. SANs are designed to provide high-speed, reliable access to large amounts of data, and are often used in enterprise environments where large amounts of data need to be stored and accessed by multiple servers and applications.  SANs provide centralized storage management, which allows administrators to allocate storage resources to servers and applications as needed. SANs typically use Fibre Channel or iSCSI protocols to connect storage devices to the network.  Fibre Channel is a high-speed, dedicated network technology that provides very low latency and high reliability.  iSCSI, on the other hand, is an IP-based protocol that allows storage devices to be connected to the network using standard Ethernet connections. SANs can provide a number of benefits, including increased performance, scalability, and availability of data.  They are often used in data centers and other large-scale IT environments to provide high-performance storage for critical applications and data.",1,210,1255,9,103,0.49047619047619045,0.3142857142857143,5.066666666666666,23.333333333333332,27.403309566250783,14.598894830659535,16.653357100415924,15.021129683784007,14.81497326203209,0.3238095238095238,0.2925764192139738,0.1091703056768559,0.08733624454148471,0.017467248908296942,0.08296943231441048,0.043668122270742356,5,0.023809523809523808,12,0,0,0,0,0.05714285714285714,0,1

"Phishing and spoofing are two common types of online scams used by cybercriminals to trick users into divulging sensitive information such as passwords, credit card numbers, and other personal data. Phishing is a type of social engineering attack where the attacker sends a fraudulent message, typically via email or instant messaging, pretending to be a trustworthy entity, such as a bank, government agency, or online service provider.  The message usually contains a link that takes the user to a fake website that looks like the legitimate one.  Once the user enters their login credentials or personal information, the attacker can use that information for various malicious purposes. Spoofing, on the other hand, involves manipulating the sender's address of an email or other communication to make it appear as if it's coming from a legitimate source, such as a known company or organization.  The goal of spoofing is to trick the recipient into thinking that the communication is legitimate and trustworthy.  This can be used to deliver phishing attacks or to spread malware. In summary, phishing is an attack that tricks users into providing sensitive information by impersonating a legitimate entity, while spoofing involves impersonating a trusted source in order to deceive the recipient into thinking that the communication is legitimate.",1,233,1351,8,117,0.5021459227467812,0.3133047210300429,4.884120171673819,29.125,25.09125000000003,16.280833333333334,19.071428571428573,16.975882523387877,13.867619047619048,0.3905579399141631,0.26582278481012656,0.12658227848101267,0.10970464135021098,0.012658227848101266,0.08860759493670886,0.046413502109704644,1,0.004291845493562232,13,0,0,0,0,0.055793991416309016,0,1

"Although it sounds similar, a storage area network (SAN) does not function as its own file server.  Rather, it attaches storage modules such as hard drives or tape libraries to an existing server so that it appears to the server’s operating system as though it were locally attached.  Typically the protocol used to attach the storage is SCSI ,, but the physical connection is fiber or high-speed Ethernet.  The emphasis for SAN applications is the need for fast access to data, such as in large online databases, e-mail servers, and high-volume file servers.  SANs offer great flexibility, since storage can be expanded without changing the network structure, and a replacement server can quickly be attached to the storage in case of hardware failure",0,139,752,5,89,0.6402877697841727,0.48201438848920863,4.503597122302159,27.8,42.68703278688528,13.36698360655738,15.989508196721312,14.265292616868656,11.844262295081972,0.3669064748201439,0.3108108108108108,0.08108108108108109,0.07432432432432433,0.02702702702702703,0.08783783783783784,0.060810810810810814,2,0.014388489208633094,9,0,0,0,0,0.06474820143884892,0,2

"Insertion sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one element at a time.  The algorithm iterates through the array and at each iteration, it takes the current element and inserts it into its correct position in the sorted subarray to the left of it. The algorithm maintains two subarrays: the sorted subarray, which starts as the first element of the array, and the unsorted subarray, which starts as the remaining elements of the array. In each step of the algorithm, the current element in the unsorted subarray is compared with the elements in the sorted subarray until its correct position is found.  The elements in the sorted subarray that are greater than the current element are shifted one position to the right to make room for the current element.  The current element is then inserted into its correct position in the sorted subarray. Insertion sort has a time complexity of O(n^2), which makes it inefficient for large arrays.  However, it is simple to implement and is useful for small arrays or for sorting partially sorted arrays.  It is also an efficient algorithm for sorting small datasets, or for use as a sub-routine in more complex algorithms.",1,222,1195,9,88,0.3963963963963964,0.22072072072072071,4.45945945945946,24.666666666666668,43.166666666666686,12.786666666666665,17.291542288557213,15.616094167265928,10.806965174129356,0.44144144144144143,0.19823788546255505,0.08370044052863436,0.14096916299559473,0.02643171806167401,0.13215859030837004,0.039647577092511016,3,0.013513513513513514,8,0,1,0,0,0.036036036036036036,1,0
"P2P Spoofing means that an attacker could have anonymously tricked aninnocent P2P user into downloading a contraband file from another user onthe P2P network.  This can occur by having an attacker modify search requestsand search results in transit by, for instance, placing the innocent user’s IPaddress in the search result packet that lists a contraband file.  Another waymight be whereby a search request for music has a hop count set to 255.  Theflawed P2P application permits the attacker to set the hop count value backto zero, thereby making the innocent user be seen as the originator.

"Sony Corporation (NYSE symbol: SNE) is the electronics business unit of Sony Group, a large Japanese multinational company that plays a leading role in worldwide electronics, games, and entertainment media (movies and music), introducing and shaping many now-familiar standards. The company traces its origin to a radio repair shop started by Masaru Ibuka in a bombed-out building in Tokyo in 1945.  He was soon joined by Akio Morita, and the men started an electronics company whose name translates in English to Tokyo Telecommunications Engineering Corporation.  They started by building tape recorders, but in the early 1950s the two entrepreneurs were among the earliest to realize the potential of the transistor, marketing transistor radios starting in 1956.  The devices essentially established the modern consumer electronics field, perfectly fitting with a new music fad among American teenagers—rock and roll. With their marketing success, Ibuka and Morita realized that they needed a simple, catchy name that would appeal to Americans and other non-Japanese customers.  In 1958 they came up with Sony.  Although the name did not exist in any language (and thus could be made proprietary), “Sony” evokes English words such as “sound” and “sonic. ” (It also resembled a Japanese slang phrase “sony-sony,” for something like what we would call “geeks” or “nerds” today. )",0,251,1379,9,150,0.5976095617529881,0.46613545816733065,4.629482071713148,27.88888888888889,32.28249078462349,14.580821484992104,16.96071616640337,15.903189008614273,13.586729857819904,0.29880478087649404,0.19402985074626866,0.09328358208955224,0.08955223880597014,0.022388059701492536,0.10074626865671642,0.029850746268656716,24,0.09561752988047809,12,0,1,0,0,0.04780876494023904,1,4
"Web cache, also known as a browser cache or HTTP cache, is a technology used by web browsers and web servers to improve the speed and efficiency of web page access. When a web page is loaded, the web browser typically downloads all of the associated resources, such as images, scripts, and stylesheets, from the web server.  With web cache, the browser can store a local copy of these resources in cache memory, so that if the user returns to the same page, the browser can load the resources from cache instead of re-downloading them from the server.  This can result in faster page load times, reduced network traffic, and lower server load. Web cache works by utilizing the available memory in a computer's RAM to store frequently accessed web page resources.  The cache can be managed by the web browser, which determines which resources should be cached based on their access patterns and available memory.  Web cache can also be implemented at the server level, where the server stores a cache of frequently accessed pages or resources to reduce server load and improve response times.",1,208,1091,7,91,0.4375,0.28365384615384615,4.336538461538462,29.714285714285715,52.05532258064518,12.599738863287254,15.574807987711214,13.484332010920856,10.495698924731183,0.3701923076923077,0.3317757009345794,0.11682242990654206,0.04205607476635514,0.028037383177570093,0.09345794392523364,0.0514018691588785,1,0.004807692307692308,14,0,0,0,0,0.0673076923076923,0,2

A basic problem in computer design is how to optimize the fetching of instructions or data so that it will be ready when the processor (CPU) needs it.  One common solution is to use a cache.  A cache is an area of relatively fast-access memory into which data can be stored in anticipation of its being needed for processing.  Caches are used mainly in two contexts: the processor cache and the disk cache,0,79,405,4,58,0.7341772151898734,0.5822784810126582,4.177215189873418,19.75,56.196181506849314,9.954897260273974,13.875342465753427,13.023866798666859,8.241095890410964,0.46835443037974683,0.25,0.07142857142857142,0.047619047619047616,0.023809523809523808,0.09523809523809523,0.10714285714285714,4,0.05063291139240506,0,0,1,0,0,0.0,0,0
"Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) means that access decisions are basedon the roles the user has as part of tasks to be performed ,. The central notion of RBAC is that users do not have discretionary access to enterprise objects.  Instead, access permissions are administrativelyassociated with roles, and users are administratively made members of appropriate roles.  This idea greatly simplifies management of authorizationwhile providing an opportunity for great flexibility in specifying and enforcing enterprise- specific protection policies.  Users can be made members ofroles as determined by their responsibilities and qualifications and can beeasily reassigned from one role to another without modifying the underlyingaccess structure.  Roles can be granted new permissions as new applicationsand actions are incorporated, and permissions can be revoked from roles asneeded.",0,134,882,6,86,0.6417910447761194,0.4925373134328358,5.641791044776119,22.333333333333332,17.69010928961751,15.843278688524592,17.969398907103823,16.32212239822248,18.019672131147534,0.35074626865671643,0.2785714285714286,0.1357142857142857,0.06428571428571428,0.02857142857142857,0.1,0.1,4,0.029850746268656716,4,0,0,0,0,0.029850746268656716,0,6

"ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange) is a series of standards used to identify simple characters (numbers, letters, etc. ) where each character is represented by a numerical code.  Each character is assigned a 7-bit code, whereby the bit has a minimum unit of data, 0 (zero) or 1.  ASCII files can be created using simple text editors.  ASCII is a universal computer code for English letters and characters.  Computers store all information as binary numbers, regardless of what make or brand the computer is.  ASCII also refers to a protocol for copying files from one computer to another over a network, in which neither computer checks for any errors that might have been caused by static or other problems.  The difficulty with ASCII is twofold: 1) 2) all special fonts and elements used in a document typed using one software (e. g. , WordPerfect) will be lost when the file / document is saved in ASCII format and than reloaded by somebody else into WordPerfect (or even Microsoft Word for that matter), and special characters such as those used in German cannot be transferred by ASCII (e. g. , ü is transferred as a blank and an ue must be typed instead).  Besides German, for many languages (e. g. , Chinese and Japanese), this represents a real problem.  For the above reasons, a new source called Unicode was developed ,.  As 8 bit codes only allow for 256 separate characters, a single 8-bit en coding is not suitable for all text requirements.  Even western alphabets have many ‘characters’, and once languages of China, and Braille are included there are many thousands of characters that are needed.  Of course, within a given domain, an implicit assumption of a particular character set could be made.  This leads to multiple 8-bit codes.  But it doesn’t work for those character sets where more than 256 characters are needed in the same context.  Both 7-bit ASCII and the various 8-bit extensions of it can be considered to be subsets of Unicode.  One does not need to know the above level of detail, but it is important to see why ASCII is insufficient, and why a standard is required for character encodings ,.",0,423,2152,17,206,0.48699763593380613,0.3309692671394799,4.182033096926714,24.88235294117647,52.68283701657461,10.407674033149174,13.759337016574586,13.348371206891418,9.770165745856357,0.375886524822695,0.17857142857142858,0.09151785714285714,0.07589285714285714,0.024553571428571428,0.09375,0.07589285714285714,37,0.08747044917257683,22,0,1,0,0,0.05200945626477541,0,10

"In hash-based sorting algorithms, a hash table is used to store the elements to be sorted.  The keys of the hash table are computed from the values of the elements using a hash function.  The values stored in the hash table can be either the elements themselves, or pointers to the elements. The elements are then sorted by iterating through the hash table and collecting the values in order.  Since hash tables do not maintain any order on their own, the order of the elements collected from the hash table must be determined based on the order of the hash keys.  In some cases, a secondary sorting algorithm may be used to sort the values with the same hash key. One advantage of hash-based sorting algorithms is that they can achieve linear time complexity in the average case, since hash table operations such as insertion and lookup can be performed in constant time on average.  However, the worst-case time complexity is typically higher than other sorting algorithms, since collisions in the hash table can lead to slower performance.",1,193,1042,8,87,0.45077720207253885,0.3005181347150259,4.455958549222798,24.125,50.22203651685393,11.781882022471915,14.967415730337079,13.81666964889586,10.30561797752809,0.42487046632124353,0.28431372549019607,0.11764705882352941,0.058823529411764705,0.014705882352941176,0.11764705882352941,0.08333333333333333,1,0.0051813471502590676,7,0,0,0,0,0.03626943005181347,1,2

"Structured data types are data types that are made up of multiple elements or components, each with its own data type.  These elements can be combined to form more complex data structures that represent real-world objects or concepts. Some examples of structured data types include:Arrays: A collection of elements of the same data type, accessed using an index or a pointer. Structures: A collection of elements of different data types, grouped together under a single name. Classes: Similar to structures, but with additional features like inheritance and encapsulation. Records: A collection of elements of different data types, used to represent a single entity or concept. Enumerations: A set of named constants, used to represent a discrete set of values. Pointers: A variable that holds the memory address of another variable or data structure. Structured data types provide a way to organize and manipulate complex data in a more manageable way.  By grouping related data elements together, structured data types make it easier to represent real-world objects and concepts in software programs.  They also provide a way to pass multiple values between functions or modules in a program, making it easier to write modular and reusable code.",1,223,1247,11,104,0.4663677130044843,0.29596412556053814,4.7040358744394615,20.272727272727273,39.404647495361786,12.18970315398887,14.678293135435991,14.291902434058311,12.75204081632653,0.3273542600896861,0.3173913043478261,0.10869565217391304,0.10869565217391304,0.021739130434782608,0.09565217391304348,0.017391304347826087,0,0.0,8,0,7,0,0,0.03587443946188341,0,2

"Open source software refers to computer software that is distributed with its source code publicly available to anyone to view, modify, and redistribute.  The term ""open source"" refers to the fact that the source code is open to the public, rather than being proprietary or closed. Open source software is typically developed collaboratively by a community of developers who contribute code and make improvements to the software over time.  This development process can result in software that is more reliable, secure, and flexible than proprietary software. Open source software can be used for a wide range of applications, from operating systems and programming languages to web servers and databases.  Some examples of popular open source software include the Linux operating system, the Apache web server, the MySQL database, and the Mozilla Firefox web browser.

"Search engines are software tools that allow users to search for information on the World Wide Web.  They have become an essential part of our daily lives, as they make it easy to find information on almost any topic.  Here is a brief background on the development of search engines and the approaches to exploring the web:Directory-based search engines: In the early days of the web, search engines were based on directories of websites.  These directories were organized by topic, and users could browse through them to find sites related to their interests.  Examples of early directory-based search engines include Yahoo! and DMOZ. Keyword-based search engines: As the number of websites on the web grew, it became impractical to rely on manual directory listings.  In the mid-1990s, keyword-based search engines were developed, which allowed users to search for specific words or phrases on the web.  Examples of early keyword-based search engines include AltaVista and Lycos. PageRank algorithm: In the late 1990s, Google introduced a new algorithm called PageRank, which revolutionized the way search engines ranked web pages.  PageRank is based on the idea that a web page is important if other important pages link to it.  This allowed Google to provide more relevant and accurate search results than its competitors. Natural language processing: In recent years, search engines have started to incorporate natural language processing techniques to better understand the intent behind user queries.  This has led to the development of more sophisticated search algorithms that can provide more personalized and accurate results. Approaches to exploring the web include:Browsing: This approach involves manually navigating through websites and following links to find information.  Browsing is useful for discovering new websites and exploring topics in depth. Keyword search: This approach involves entering one or more keywords into a search engine and viewing the search results.  Keyword search is useful for finding specific information quickly. Natural language search: This approach involves entering a question or phrase into a search engine and allowing the search engine to interpret the query and provide relevant results.  Natural language search is useful for complex or nuanced queries that may not be easily expressed as keywords.",1,398,2353,20,168,0.4221105527638191,0.2562814070351759,4.984924623115578,19.9,43.32311231990593,11.89752719788298,14.017289032637459,13.531616421267348,14.059217877094973,0.3417085427135678,0.2761904761904762,0.1357142857142857,0.08095238095238096,0.02142857142857143,0.09285714285714286,0.04047619047619048,21,0.052763819095477386,9,0,9,1,0,0.02512562814070352,0,2

"A fundamental problem in computer design is the control of devices such as disk drives and printers.  Each device is designed to respond to a particular set of control commands sent as patterns of binary values through the port to which the device is connected.  For example, a printer will respond to a “new page” command by skipping lines to the end of the current page and moving the print head to the start of the next page, taking margin settings into account.  The problem is this: When an applications program such as a word processor needs to print a document, how should the necessary commands be provided to the printer? If every application program has to include the appropriate set of commands for each device that might be in use, programs will be bloated and much development effort will be required for supporting devices rather than extending the functionality of the product itself.  Instead, the manufacturers of printers and other devices such as scanners and graphics tablets typically provide a program called a driver.  (A version of the driver is created for each major operating system in use. ) The driver serves as the intermediary between the application, the operating system and the low-level device control system.  It is sometimes useful to have drivers in the form of continually running programs that monitor the status of a device and wait for commands.",0,252,1388,9,129,0.5119047619047619,0.376984126984127,4.563492063492063,28.0,42.83090038314177,13.689195402298854,15.48352490421456,13.731508374201276,11.276724137931037,0.44841269841269843,0.29615384615384616,0.09615384615384616,0.06538461538461539,0.019230769230769232,0.1346153846153846,0.057692307692307696,0,0.0,6,0,1,0,1,0.027777777777777776,0,0

"The ""darknet"" refers to a private and encrypted network that is hidden from the public internet and is only accessible through specialized software, configurations, and authorization.  Darknets are often used to provide anonymous and untraceable communication channels for individuals or groups who want to keep their online activities private or hidden from surveillance. The most well-known darknet is the Tor network, which is a decentralized and anonymous network that allows users to browse the internet anonymously, access hidden services, and communicate privately.  However, not all darknets are used for legitimate purposes, and some are used to facilitate illegal activities such as drug trafficking, hacking, and online marketplaces for illicit goods and services. It's important to note that the term ""darknet"" is often conflated with the ""deep web,"" which refers to parts of the internet that are not indexed by search engines and are not easily accessible through standard web browsers.

It allows code to be more flexible and reusable by allowing different objects to be used interchangeably.

Each shape has its own unique properties and methods, such as its size, color, and the ability to calculate its perimeter.

"Once the document page has been scanned into an imageformat, there are various ways to identify the characters. One method is to use stored templates that indicate the pattern of pixels that should correspond to each character.  Generally, a threshold of similarity is defined so that an exactmatch is not necessary to classify a character: The templatemost similar to the character is chosen.  Some systems storea set of templates for each of the fonts most commonly foundin printed text.  (Recognizing cursive writing is a much morecomplex process: See handwriting recognition. )A more generalized method uses structural features(such as “all t’s have a single vertical line and a shortercrossbar line”) to classify characters.  To analyze a character,the different types of individual features are identified andthen compared to a set of rules to determine the charactercorresponding to that particular combination of features. Sometimes thresholds or “fuzzy logic” are used to decidethe probable identity of a character.",0,179,1024,8,110,0.6145251396648045,0.48044692737430167,4.843575418994414,22.375,31.83001623376626,13.601915584415586,18.089610389610392,16.218646115125612,14.487012987012989,0.4022346368715084,0.24444444444444444,0.1388888888888889,0.07777777777777778,0.03333333333333333,0.07777777777777778,0.05555555555555555,1,0.00558659217877095,3,0,2,0,0,0.01675977653631285,0,2
"A scanner is a device that captures images or text and converts them into digital data that can be stored, manipulated, and transmitted.  The first scanners were developed in the 1950s and 1960s for specialized applications such as document archiving and scientific research. In the 1980s, scanners became more widely available as personal computers became more popular.  The earliest scanners were flatbed scanners that used a moving light source and a photosensitive element to scan documents or images.  Over time, scanners became more sophisticated, with faster scanning speeds, higher resolutions, and more advanced features such as automatic document feeders, optical character recognition (OCR), and duplex scanning. Today, scanners are used in a variety of applications, from document archiving and digitization to graphic design, medical imaging, and security screening.  There are many different types of scanners available, including flatbed scanners, sheet-fed scanners, handheld scanners, and drum scanners, each with their own strengths and limitations.

"Quick sort is a widely-used sorting algorithm that uses a divide-and-conquer strategy to sort an array of elements.  The algorithm works by selecting a ""pivot"" element from the array and partitioning the other elements into two subarrays, according to whether they are less than or greater than the pivot.  The pivot element is then placed between the two subarrays. The partitioning process is repeated recursively on each of the subarrays until the entire array is sorted.  The two subarrays are sorted independently using quick sort. Quick sort has a time complexity of O(n log n) in the average case and O(n^2) in the worst case.  However, it is generally faster than other sorting algorithms for large arrays due to its efficient use of memory and cache.  It is widely used in practice and is often the sorting algorithm of choice for many programming languages and applications.",1,164,884,8,90,0.5487804878048781,0.3597560975609756,4.487804878048781,20.5,43.44823630136989,11.732979452054796,15.51917808219178,14.37465228746014,10.942465753424656,0.40853658536585363,0.2046783625730994,0.10526315789473684,0.0935672514619883,0.04678362573099415,0.12280701754385964,0.05263157894736842,3,0.018292682926829267,2,0,0,0,0,0.012195121951219513,1,0

"Integers (whole numbers) have the simplest representation, but there are two important considerations: the totalnumber of bits available and whether one bit is used to holdthe sign. Since all numbers are stored as binary digits, an unsignedinteger has a range from 0 to 2bits where “bits” is the totalnumber of bits available.  Thus if there are 16 bits available, the maximum value for an integer is 65535.  If negativenumbers are to be handled, a signed integer must be used(in most languages such as C, C++, and Java, an integer issigned unless unsigned is specified).  Since one bit is usedto hold the sign and each bit doubles the maximum size, itfollows that a signed integer can have only half the rangeabove or below zero.  Thus, a 16-bit signed integer can rangefrom -32,768 to 32,767. One complication is that the available sizes of integersdepend on whether the computer system’s native data sizeis 16, 32, or 64 bits.  In most cases the native size is 32 bits,so the declaration “int” in a C program on such a machineimplies a signed 32-bit integer that can range from - 231 or-2,147,483,647 to 231-1, or 2,147,483,647.  However, if one isusing large numbers in a program, it is important to checkthat the chosen type is large enough.

"While the attention of the first computer designers focused mainly on numeric calculations, it was clear that much of the data that business people and others would want to manipulate with the new machines would be textual in nature.  Billing records, for example, would have to include customer names and addresses, not just balance totals. The “natural” representation of data in a computer is as a series of two-state (binary) values, interpreted as binary numbers.  The solution for representing text (letters of the alphabet, punctuation marks, and other special symbols) is to assign a numeric value to each text symbol.  The result is a character code, such as ASCII (American Standard Code for Information Interchange), which is the scheme used most widely today.

"In computer science, a binder refers to a software tool that is used to combine two or more files or programs into a single executable file.  Binders are commonly used by malware authors to merge a legitimate program or file with a malicious payload, allowing the malware to execute without being detected by antivirus software or other security measures. Binders work by taking two or more files and merging them into a single executable file, which can then be run on a target system.  Binders can be designed to include a variety of malicious payloads, including backdoors, keyloggers, and other types of malware. Binders can be used to bypass security measures that are designed to detect and prevent malware infections, as the merged files may appear to be a legitimate program or file.  This can make it more difficult for security professionals to detect and remove the malware, and can lead to serious security breaches and data loss. Binders are a security threat, and it is important to use strong security measures, such as antivirus software and network monitoring tools, to detect and prevent malware infections.  It is also important to be cautious when downloading and running software or files from unknown sources, and to ensure that all software and systems are kept up-to-date with the latest security patches and updates.",1,241,1341,8,112,0.46473029045643155,0.2987551867219917,4.634854771784233,30.125,39.83725395927604,14.56565045248869,16.298868778280543,14.37465228746014,11.86606334841629,0.4107883817427386,0.26506024096385544,0.13253012048192772,0.08433734939759036,0.020080321285140562,0.06827309236947791,0.07630522088353414,2,0.008298755186721992,12,0,0,0,0,0.04979253112033195,0,1

"NLP is a multidisciplinary field that draws from linguis-tics and computer science, particularly artificial intelligence ,.  In terms of linguistics, a program must be able to deal with words that have multiple mean-ings (“wind up the clock” and “the wind is cold today”) as well as grammatical ambiguities (in the phrase “little girl’s school” is it the school that is little, the girls, or both?).  Of course each language has its own forms of ambiguity. Programs can use several strategies for dealing with these problems, including using statistical models to predict the likely meaning of a given phrase based on a “corpus” of existing text in that language ,. As formidable as the task of extracting the correct (lit-eral) meaning from text can be, it is really only the first level of natural language processing.  If a program is to success-fully summarize or draw conclusions about a news report from North Korea, for example, it would also have to have a knowledge base of facts about that country and/or a set of “frames” , about how to interpret vari-ous situations such as threat, bluff, or compromise. )",0,222,1117,6,126,0.5675675675675675,0.42342342342342343,4.18018018018018,37.0,41.349631147541004,15.068934426229507,18.53879781420765,15.688483145680365,11.246994535519129,0.3963963963963964,0.2264957264957265,0.08974358974358974,0.08974358974358974,0.042735042735042736,0.1111111111111111,0.05555555555555555,4,0.018018018018018018,13,0,0,0,1,0.06306306306306306,0,2

"The DVD (alternatively, Digital Video Disc or Digital Versatile Disc) is similar to a CD, but uses laser light with a shorter wavelength.  This means that the size of the pits and lands will be considerably smaller, which in turns means that much more data can be stored on the same size disk.  A DVD disk typically stores up to 4. 7 GB of data, equivalent to about six CDs.  This capacity can be doubled by using both sides of the disk. The high capacity of DVD-ROMs (and their recordable equivalent, DVD-RAMs) makes them useful for storing feature-length movies or videos, very large games and multimedia programs, or large illustrated encyclopedias.  The development of high-definition television (HDTV) standards spurred the introduction of higher capacity DVD formats.

"Computing has had a significant impact on the design, manufacturing, and operation of cars, leading to the development of various computer-based systems and technologies in the automotive industry.  Some examples of how computing is used in cars are:Engine Management Systems: Modern cars have sophisticated engine management systems that use computer algorithms to control the fuel injection, ignition timing, and other aspects of engine operation.  These systems use sensors to monitor various parameters like engine temperature, air/fuel ratio, and throttle position, and adjust the engine parameters accordingly to optimize performance, fuel efficiency, and emissions. Infotainment Systems: Cars today are equipped with advanced infotainment systems that provide entertainment, navigation, and communication functions.  These systems use touchscreens, voice commands, and other input devices to allow drivers and passengers to control music, phone calls, messaging, and other functions while driving. Autonomous Driving: The development of self-driving cars is one of the most exciting areas of research in the automotive industry.  Self-driving cars use a variety of sensors, including cameras, radar, and lidar, to detect and analyze their surroundings and make decisions about how to navigate.  These systems use complex computer algorithms to control the vehicle's speed, steering, and braking, allowing it to operate autonomously. Safety Systems: Many modern cars come equipped with advanced safety systems that use computing technology to detect and prevent accidents.  For example, anti-lock braking systems (ABS) use sensors and computer algorithms to prevent skidding and maintain control of the vehicle during emergency braking, while electronic stability control (ESC) systems use sensors and actuators to prevent the vehicle from sliding or spinning out of control.",1,311,1881,10,144,0.4630225080385852,0.3086816720257235,5.183279742765273,31.1,10.51854545454546,18.350696969696973,21.923636363636366,18.878054631974784,17.373484848484846,0.28938906752411575,0.3302752293577982,0.1345565749235474,0.06422018348623854,0.009174311926605505,0.07033639143730887,0.01529051987767584,4,0.012861736334405145,26,0,5,0,0,0.08360128617363344,0,4

"Java is a high-level, object-oriented programming language that is used to create a wide range of applications, from desktop software to mobile apps and web applications.  It was first introduced in 1995 by Sun Microsystems, and is now owned and developed by Oracle Corporation. One of the key features of Java is its platform independence, which means that Java code can be run on any platform that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.  This makes Java programs highly portable and enables developers to write code that can run on a wide range of devices without modification. Java is also known for its ease of use and maintainability, with a syntax that is designed to be straightforward and easy to learn, even for beginners.  It is based on an object-oriented programming model, which allows developers to write code that is organized around objects and their interactions. In addition to its core language features, Java also has a large and active community of developers who have created a wide range of libraries, frameworks, and tools that can be used to simplify common programming tasks, such as database access, network communication, and user interface design. Overall, Java is a versatile and powerful programming language that is used by millions of developers around the world for a wide range of applications, and it is considered to be one of the most popular and widely-used programming languages in the world.",1,269,1474,8,131,0.48698884758364314,0.34944237918215615,4.5762081784386615,33.625,34.0880005186722,15.988625518672201,19.518879668049795,16.827784334635936,12.073029045643157,0.39776951672862454,0.22142857142857142,0.11071428571428571,0.060714285714285714,0.03571428571428571,0.10714285714285714,0.07142857142857142,15,0.055762081784386616,18,0,0,0,0,0.06691449814126393,0,2
"A simulation is a simplified (but adequate) model that represents how a system works.  The system can be an existing, real-world one, such as a stock market or a human heart, or a proposed design for a system, such as a new factory or even a space colony. If a system is simple enough (a cannonball falling from a height, for example), it is possible to use formulas such as those provided by Newton to get an exact answer.  However, many real-world systems involve many discrete entities with complex interactions that cannot be captured with a single equation.  During the 1940s, scientists encountered just this problem in attempting to understand what would happen under various conditions in a nuclear reaction. Together with physicist Enrico Fermi, two mathematicians, John von Neumann , and Stanislaw Ulam, devised a new way to simulate complex systems.  Instead of trying fruitlessly to come up with some huge formula to “solve” the whole system, they applied probability formulas to each of a number of particles—in effect, “rolling the dice” for each one and then observing their resulting distribution and behavior.  Because of its analogy to gambling, this became known as the Monte Carlo method.  It turned out to be widely useful not only for simulating nuclear reactions and particle physics but for many other activities (such as bombing raids or the spread of disease) where many separate things behave according to probabilities.",0,270,1447,9,162,0.6,0.4666666666666667,4.466666666666667,30.0,34.172222222222246,14.979716312056741,18.10401891252955,16.728156217252725,11.918297872340428,0.3962962962962963,0.20567375886524822,0.09929078014184398,0.10638297872340426,0.03546099290780142,0.1099290780141844,0.03546099290780142,7,0.025925925925925925,15,0,0,0,0,0.05555555555555555,1,7

"In computer programming, a character is a single symbol, such as a letter, number, or punctuation mark, that can be represented in a computer's memory using a binary code.  Characters are used to represent textual data, such as words and sentences, in computer programs. A string is a sequence of characters that are treated as a single unit in a computer program.  Strings are typically used to represent text data, such as names, addresses, and other types of textual information.  In many programming languages, strings are denoted by enclosing the sequence of characters within quotation marks. Strings are useful for manipulating text data in computer programs.  Common operations on strings include concatenation (combining two or more strings into a single string), substring extraction (extracting a portion of a string), and searching for specific characters or patterns within a string. In addition to representing plain text, strings can also be used to represent other types of data, such as binary data or encoded data.

Syntactically, Eiffel emphasizes simple, reusable declarations that make the program easier to understand, and tries to avoid obscure or lower-level code such as compiler optimizations.",0,100,632,5,72,0.72,0.62,5.41,20.0,19.771000000000015,14.874000000000002,16.130909090909093,15.381575749822971,17.318181818181824,0.3,0.22857142857142856,0.13333333333333333,0.08571428571428572,0.0380952380952381,0.0761904761904762,0.01904761904761905,7,0.07,5,0,0,0,0,0.05,0,0
"Timing attacks were publicized by Paul Kocher in 1996.  They attack the implementation of cryptosystems by measuring observable differences in the timing of the algorithm based on the particular value of the key.  They then use statistical methods to determine the bits of key by observing many operations using the same key.  Timing attacks typically require a significant number of chosen ciphertexts.  Related attacks can use any measure of differences in the performance of the encryption and decryption functions such as power consumption and heat dissipation.  Timing attacks and related attacks can be protected against to some degree by “blinding” the devices performing encryption and decryption computations so that all computations have the same performance, regardless of the particular key and message being used.  However, this can have a substantial performance cost, as it requires all computations to have worst-case performance.  Such attacks can also be protected against by designing systems so that they will not act as an “oracle” by decrypting and returning all and any messages that come their way, thereby preventing an attacker from obtaining the necessary data to carry out the attack.  However, this is not always possible without interfering with the purpose of the system.",0,217,1302,9,117,0.5391705069124424,0.3548387096774194,5.046082949308755,24.11111111111111,31.15344444444446,14.434666666666669,18.88888888888889,16.99224021665606,14.072,0.4423963133640553,0.2543859649122807,0.12280701754385964,0.06578947368421052,0.03508771929824561,0.12280701754385964,0.043859649122807015,2,0.009216589861751152,5,0,0,0,0,0.02304147465437788,2,4

"The implementation of an ontology involves several steps, which may vary depending on the specific ontology language, tools, and application domain.  Here is a general overview of the typical process:Define the ontology scope and requirements: Identify the domain or area of knowledge that the ontology will cover, and specify the purpose and goals of the ontology.  This step involves analyzing existing data sources, documents, and experts' knowledge to determine the relevant concepts, relationships, and properties that need to be represented in the ontology. Design the ontology structure: Decide on the ontology language and modeling approach to use, and create a conceptual model that defines the classes, properties, and relationships in the ontology.  This step involves using ontology editors or modeling tools to define the ontology schema, which may include axioms, constraints, and rules. Implement the ontology schema: Transform the conceptual model into a formal representation in the chosen ontology language, such as OWL or RDF.  This step involves using ontology editors or programming languages to define the ontology's classes, properties, and relationships and to ensure that the ontology conforms to the language syntax and semantics. Populate the ontology with data: Import or generate data that conforms to the ontology schema and annotate the data with ontology terms and concepts.  This step involves using data integration tools or APIs to map the data to the ontology classes and properties and to ensure that the data is consistent and aligned with the ontology's semantics. Validate and evaluate the ontology: Verify the correctness and completeness of the ontology schema and the data, and test the ontology against use cases and scenarios.  This step involves using reasoning engines or validation tools to detect errors, inconsistencies, or ambiguities in the ontology and to ensure that the ontology meets the intended goals and requirements. Deploy and maintain the ontology: Publish the ontology to a repository or server that allows other users or systems to access and use it, and maintain the ontology by updating it with new data or knowledge, refining its schema, or extending its scope. Overall, the implementation of an ontology requires a systematic and iterative approach that involves collaboration between domain experts, ontology designers, and software developers.  It also requires a good understanding of the ontology language and tools, as well as the application domain and data sources.",1,437,2540,14,155,0.35469107551487417,0.2288329519450801,4.917620137299771,31.214285714285715,15.655487012987038,17.907467532467532,21.493506493506494,18.548980349730343,14.729870129870132,0.3684210526315789,0.32657657657657657,0.13288288288288289,0.033783783783783786,0.01126126126126126,0.06306306306306306,0.013513513513513514,3,0.006864988558352402,27,0,7,0,0,0.06178489702517163,0,5
